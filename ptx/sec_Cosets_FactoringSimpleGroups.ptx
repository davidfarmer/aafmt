    <title>Concepts, definitions, and examples</title>
    <p>
      In the previous section we talked about how a normal subgroup enables us to
      <q>factor</q>
      a group to obtain two groups with fewer elements (i.e. the group of cosets,
      and the normal subgroup).
      This seems quite similar to the idea of factoring positive integers as a product of smaller numbers.
      In fact, just as with positive integers,
      the process can be continued.
      To be precise: suppose that <m>G</m> is a group,
      and <m>N_1</m> is a normal subgroup.
      Suppose further that <m>N_2</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>N_1</m>.
      Then we can
      <q>factor</q>
      <m>G</m> into three groups,
      namely <m>G/N_1</m>, <m>N_1/N_2</m>, and <m>N_2</m>.
      Evidently the process can be continued:
      if <m>N_2</m> has a normal subgroup <m>N_3</m>, then we can
      <q>factor</q>
      <m>G</m> into four groups:
      <m>G/N_1</m>, <m>N_1/N_2</m>,
      <m>N_2/N_3</m>, and <m>N_3</m>.
      When does this process end?
      Eventually, we will reach a group in which the only normal subgroup is the trivial subgroup <m>\{e\}</m>.
      But factoring by <m>\{e\}</m> doesn't give a group with fewer elements,
      because the number of cosets of the identity in any group <m>G</m> is (by Lagrange's theorem)
      <me>
        \frac{|G|}{|\{e\}|} = \frac{|G|}{1} = |G|
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus factoring a group by <m>\{e\}</m> is kind of like dividing an integer by 1:
      it doesn't change anything.
      So a group with no nontrivial normal subgroups is like a prime number:
      it can't be factored any further.
      A group with no nontrivial normal subgroups is called a <term>simple group</term>
          <idx><h>Group</h><h>simple</h></idx>.
          <idx><h>Simple group</h></idx>
      Just like any positive integer uniquely factors into a product of prime numbers,
      it turns out that any group can be factored into a series of simple groups,
      and the factors are
      (in some sense)
      unique.
      There's a beautiful theorem,
      called the <term> Jordan-H&#xf6;lder Theorem</term>,
      which characterizes these factors.
      Unfortunately,
      the precise statement of the theorem is somewhat involved,
      so we leave to the interested reader to research this topic further.<fn>

              This exercise shows that although the factors of a group are unique

      We've been comparing simple groups to prime numbers,
      but actually they are somewhat more complicated than prime numbers.
      There are several infinite classes of simple groups
      (as well as a few simple groups which defy classification<ndash/>see the Remark at the end of this section.)
      We've already seen one such class:
      the groups of prime order.
      As we noted at the end of <xref ref="sec_Cosets_LagrangeTheorem">Section</xref>,
      these groups are simple since they have no nontrivial proper subgroups.

      Let's consider the simplicity question for some other groups.
      We'll start with the symmetric groups <m>S_n</m>

      Although <m>A_4</m> is not simple,
      it turns out that the alternating groups <m>A_n</m> are simple for <m>n \geq 5</m>.
      We will prove this result by looking at properties of 3-cycles.
      The strategy is to establish the following two facts:
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          <p>
            The only normal subgroup of
            <m>A_n (n \geq 3)</m> that contains a 3-cycle is <m>A_n</m> itself.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Any nontrivial normal subgroup of <m>A_n (n \geq 5)</m> contains a 3-cycle.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Facts (1) and (2) then imply that the only nontrivial normal subgroup of
      <m>A_n (n \geq 5)</m> is <m>A_n</m> itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we can prove facts (1) and (2),
      we need first a preliminary result:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Cosets_normal_3cycle_lemma1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The alternating group <m>A_n</m> is generated by <m>3</m>-cycles for <m>n \geq 3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We know that any element <m>\sigma</m> of <m>A_n</m> is an even permutation,
        so <m>\sigma</m> can be expressed as the product of an even number of transpositions.
        In this expression for <m>\sigma</m> we may pair up the transpositions two by two,
        and thus obtain an expression for <m>\sigma</m> as a product of
        <em>pairs</em> of transpositions.
        Now consider any pair of transpositions.
        Either the pair has both elements in common;
        or the pair has one element in common;
        or the pair has no elements in common.
        In other words,
        the three possibilities for any pair of transpositions are:
        <me>
          (ab)(ab) \text{ or }  (ab)(bc)  \text{ or }  (ab)(cd)  \text{ (where }  a,b,c,d \text{ are all different elements of }  A_n)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may write all of these pairs of transpositions as follows:
        <md>
          <mrow>(ab)(ab) \amp  = e</mrow>
          <mrow>(ab)(bc) \amp  = (abc)</mrow>
          <mrow>(ab)(cd) \amp  = (abc)(bcd)</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By substituting pairs of transpositions in the product expression for <m>\sigma</m> with equivalent 3-cycle expressions,
        we may express the arbitrary element
        <m>\sigma \in A_n</m> as a product of 3-cycles.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Before continuing onward with our proof,
      let's do a few examples to see how this works.

      Armed with <xref ref="proposition_Cosets_normal_3cycle_lemma1">Proposition</xref>
      we're now able to prove fact (1).
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Cosets_normal_3cycle_lemma2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>N</m> be a normal subgroup of <m>A_n</m>, where <m>n \geq 3</m>.

    <proof>

        We will first show that <m>A_n</m> is generated by 3-cycles of the specific form <m>(ijk)</m>,

        <m>\{ 1, 2, \ldots,

        Every 3-cycle is the product of 3-cycles of this form, since

        Now suppose that <m>N</m> is a nontrivial normal subgroup of <m>A_n</m> for
        <m>n \geq 3</m> such that <m>N</m> contains a 3-cycle of the form <m>(i j a)</m>.
        Using the normality of <m>N</m>, we see that

          [(i j)(a k)](i j a)^2 [(i j)(a k)]^{-1} = (i j k)
        </me>
        is in <m>N</m>.
        Hence, <m>N</m> must contain all of the 3-cycles <m>(i j k)</m> for <m>1 \leq k \leq n</m>.
        By <xref ref="proposition_Cosets_normal_3cycle_lemma1">Proposition</xref>,
        these 3-cycles generate <m>A_n</m>;

      <p>
        Let <m>\sigma</m> be an arbitrary element in a normal subgroup <m>N</m>.
        The possible cycle structures for <m>\sigma</m> are as follows:

          The alternating group, <m>A_n</m>,

    <title>The simplicity of <m>A_n</m> and the impossibility of polynomial root formulas</title>
    <p>
      We've just spent several pages proving that <m>A_n</m> is simple for <m>n \ge 5</m>.
      What's the big deal?
      It turns out that this fact played a key role in a VERY big deal in the history of mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider any second-degree real polynomial <m>a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0</m>.
      We may find the roots of the polynomial using the quadratic formula.
      But what if the polynomial is of degree three (<m>a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0</m>) or higher?
      It turns out there's a formula for finding the roots of an arbitrary real cubic (degree 3) polynomial.
      There's even a formula for finding the roots of quartic equations.
      All of these formulas involve arithmetic operations (<m>+.,-,\cdot,/</m>) and radicals
      (square roots, cube roots, etc.)
      But how about quintic
      (fifth order)
      and higher order polynomials?
      It turns out that for fifth or higher order polynomials there's no such formula for finding the roots using arithmetic operations and radicals.
      It's not just that we haven't found one<ndash/>we can prove that
      <em>such a formula is impossible</em>.
      Proving this was one of the all-time great discoveries of mathematics,
      in which Abel, Ruffini, and Galois all played important roles.
      The theoretical foundations required for this proof are found in an area of abstract algebra known as
      <term>Galois Theory</term>.
      You may find chapters on Galois Theory in most advanced undergraduate textbooks on abstract algebra.
    </p>
    <p>
      An outline of the proof strategy is as follows.
      Each of the following steps requires extensive proof
      (which we won't supply),
      but at least you can see how the argument goes:
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          <p>
            An <m>n</m>th order real polynomial has up to <m>n</m> distinct roots,
            which may be real or complex and are irrational in general.
            (This follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Associated with the roots of a given real polynomial is a certain type of symmetry group called the
            <term>Galois group</term>.
            For an <m>n</m>th order polynomial,
            the Galois group is a subgroup of <m>S_n</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In order for a formula to exist for a given real polynomial's roots that involves only arithmetic operations and radicals,
            the Galois group of the polynomial must be factorable in such a way that the factors are all abelian groups.
            (This is the hardest step.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            There are <m>n</m>th order real polynomials that have <m>S_n</m> as their Galois group.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            It isn't possible to factor <m>S_n</m> into abelian factors,
            since <m>S_n</m> factors into <m>\mathbb{Z}_2</m> and <m>A_n</m>,
            and <m>A_n</m> is simple and non-abelian.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            It follows that there can be no such formula for the roots of such polynomials,
            so there can't be a root formula that works in general.

            <li>
              <p>
                Let <m>S</m> be the set of roots of the real polynomial <m>a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0</m>.
                Show that <m>H</m> is a group of symmetries for <m>S</m>:
                that is, <m>h(S)=S</m> for any <m>h \in H</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                Show that <m>H</m> factors in such a way that all the factors are abelian simple groups.
                (It therefore satisfies the criterion for a root solution formula to exist.)

        (<em>historical background</em>) It is impossible to overstate the importance of simple groups in mathematics and physics.
        Groups are the fundamental mathematical tools used to describe the symmetries and regularities which we observe in the physical world<ndash/>and simple groups,
        as mentioned in the text,
        are the building blocks from which all finite groups may be built.
      </p>
      <p>
        The earliest work on the classification problem dates back over 200 years.
        The first non-abelian simple groups to be discovered were the alternating groups,
        and Galois was the first to prove that <m>A_5</m> was simple.
        Later mathematicians, such as C.<nbsp/>Jordan
            <idx><h>Jordan, C.</h></idx>
        and L.<nbsp/>E.<nbsp/>Dickson,
            <idx><h>Dickson, L. E.</h></idx>
        found several infinite families of matrix groups that were simple.
        Other families of simple groups were discovered in the 1950s.
        Around 1900 William Burnside
            <idx><h>Burnside's conjecture</h></idx>
        conjectured that all non-abelian simple groups must have even order.
        But it wasn't until 1963 that Walter Feit and John Thompson published a 250-page proof of Burnside's conjecture.
        After this breakthrough,
        mathematicians redoubled their efforts to complete the classification.
        Hundreds of mathematicians produced thousands of pages of proofs.
        Success was announced in 1983,
        but a gap was later discovered,
        and it was not until 2004 that one of the great intellectual achievements of all time was finally accomplished.
        The final result:
        all finite simple groups belong to 18 countably infinite families,
        except for 26 exceptional
        <q>sporadic</q>
        groups.
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>sporadic</h></idx>
        The largest of these groups (called the
        <q>monster</q>
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>monster</h></idx>
        has over 80 trillion trillion trillion trillion entries,
        which is more than 100 times the number of atoms in the earth!
