  <title>Proof that <m>U(p)</m> is cyclic</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Mathematics has many mysterious and wonderful connections.
      In this section,
      we will pull together several ideas from previous chapters to prove a key property of an important family of abelian groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that <m>U(n)</m> is the group of units in <m>\ZZ_n</m>,
      where a <em>unit</em><idx><h>Unit</h><h>in <m>\ZZ_n</m></h></idx>' is an element with a multiplicative inverse.
      If <m>p</m> is a prime,
      then <m>U(p)</m> is the set of all nonzero elements of <m>\ZZ_p</m>.
      In some coding theory applications,
      it's important to find elements of <m>U(p)</m> which have a very larger order (recall that the <em>order</em>
      of a group element <m>g \in G</m>
      (denoted by <m>|g|</m>)
      is the smallest positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>g^n = {\var id}</m>).
      Now, we know from Lagrange's theorem that <m>|g|</m> divides <m>|G|</m> for any <m>g \in G</m>.
      It follows that <m>|g| \le |G|</m>.
      We also have the following necessary and sufficient conditions for when <m>|g|=|G|</m>:
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a finite group <m>G</m>,
          prove <m>G</m> is cyclic if and only if
          <m>|G| = |g|</m> for some <m>g \in G</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      Now, we know from <xref ref="proposition_Isomorphism_isomorph_theorem_4">Proposition</xref>
      that any group of prime order is cyclic.
      Does this imply that <m>U(p)</m> must be cyclic?
      Alas, the answer is negative:
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that if <m>p</m> is a prime greater than 3, then <m>|U(p)|</m> is <em>not</em> a prime.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      But all is not lost!
      Even though <m>|U(p)|</m> is not prime,
      we can still prove that <m>U(p)</m> is cyclic.
      To do this, we will need results from the Polynomials and Cosets chapters,
      as well as from this chapter.
      Here we go:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Isomorphism_Up_cyclic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>U(p)</m> is cyclic for every prime <m>p</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        First, notice that <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_FTOA">Proposition</xref>
        says that there are at most <m>m</m> solutions to the equation <m>x^m = 1</m> in <m>\ZZ_p</m>.
        Since 0 is not a solution,
        it follow that all of these solutions are also in <m>U(p)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, according to the factorization of Abelian groups
        (<xref ref="proposition_Isomorphism_FactorabelianGroup">Proposition</xref>),
        there exists an isomorphism <m>\phi</m>:
        <me>
          \phi: U(p)  \rightarrow {\mathbb{Z}_{{p_1}^{e_1}}}  \times   {\mathbb{Z}_{{p_2}^{e_2}}}  \times  ... \times   {\mathbb{Z}_{{p_k}^{e_k}}}
        </me>,
        where <m>p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k</m> are all primes.
        It's not necessarily true a priori that all of the <m>p_j</m>'s are distinct:
        but if they are,
        then <xref ref="proposition_Isomorphism_RelativelyPrime">Proposition</xref>
        tells us that <m>U(p)</m> must be cyclic.
      </p>
      <p>
        So it all comes down to proving that all of the <m>p_j</m>'s are distinct.
        We will prove this by contradiction.We begin as usual by supposing the opposite of what we want to prove:
        namely, that <m>p_i = p_j</m> for some <m>i \neq j</m>.
        Now consider the following two elements of the direct product:
        <me>
          g_i = ( 0, \ldots , \underbrace{p_i^{e_i-1}}_{i'\text{ th place } }, \ldots,0) \mathrm{~ and ~} g_j = ( 0, \ldots , \underbrace{p_j^{e_j-1}}_{j'\text{ th place } }, \ldots,0)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is then possible to prove that (recall that
        <q><m>|g|</m></q>
        is the order of the group element <m>g</m> )
        <me>
          |g_i| = p_i \mathrm{~ and ~}  |g_j| = p_j
        </me>.
      </p>
      <exercise xml:id="exercise_Isomorphism_orders">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Given the above definitions of <m>g_i</m> and <m>g_j</m>,
            show that <m>|g_i| = p_i</m> and <m>|g_j| = p_j</m>. (*Hint*)
          </p>
        </statement>
      </exercise>
      <p>
        As a result of the above exercise,
        <xref ref="proposition_Cosets_cosets_theorem_7">Proposition</xref> enables us to conclude that
        <me>
          |g_i^n| = p_i \mathrm{~ and ~} |g_j^n| = p_j \mathrm{~ for~~} (n = 1,...,p_j-1)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>p_i = p_j</m>, we have at least
        <m>2(p_i-1)</m> elements in <m>{\mathbb{Z}_{{p_1}^{e_1}}} \times {\mathbb{Z}_{{p_2}^{e_2}}} \times ... \times {\mathbb{Z}_{{p_k}^{e_k}}}</m> of order <m>p_i</m>.
        By <xref ref="proposition_Isomorphism_isomorph_theorem_1">Proposition</xref>,
        this means there are <m>2(p_i-1)</m> elements of <m>U(p)</m> which have order <m>p_i</m>,
        and all of these elements are solutions of the equation <m>x^{p_i}-1=0</m> (Why?).
        But at the beginning of this proof,
        we demonstrated that there can only be at most <m>p_i</m> solutions.
        This contradiction shows us our supposition is false,
        so all of the <m>p_i</m>'s in the direct product must be unequal.

      The direct product of two groups builds a large group out of two smaller groups.
      We would like to be able to reverse this process and conveniently break down a group into its direct product components;
      that is, we would like to be able to say when a group is isomorphic to the direct product of two of its subgroups.

          Let <m>G</m> be the internal direct product of subgroups <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>.
          Then <m>G</m> is isomorphic to <m>H \times K</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>G</m> is an internal direct product,
        we can write any element <m>g \in G</m> as <m>g =hk</m> for some <m>h \in H</m> and some <m>k \in K</m>.
        Define a map <m>\phi : G \rightarrow H \times K</m> by <m>\phi(g) = (h,k)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first problem that we must face is to show that <m>\phi</m> is a well-defined map;
        that is, we must show that <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> are uniquely determined by <m>g</m>.
        Suppose that <m>g = hk=h'k'</m>.
        Then <m>h^{-1} h'= k (k')^{-1}</m> is in both <m>H</m> and <m>K</m>,
        so it must be the identity.
        Therefore, <m>h = h'</m> and <m>k = k'</m>,
        which proves that <m>\phi</m> is, indeed, well-defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        To show that <m>\phi</m> preserves the group operation,
        let <m>g_1 = h_1 k_1</m> and <m>g_2 = h_2 k_2</m> and observe that
        <md>
          <mrow>\phi( g_1 g_2 ) \amp  = \phi( h_1 k_1 h_2 k_2 )</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \phi(h_1  h_2 k_1 k_2)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = (h_1  h_2, k_1 k_2)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = (h_1, k_1)( h_2, k_2)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \phi( g_1 ) \phi(  g_2 )</mrow>
        </md>.
