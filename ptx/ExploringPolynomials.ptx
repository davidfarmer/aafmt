  <title>Exploration: Relating polynomials and matrices</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous chapter,
      we formally introduced the concept of
      <em>isomorphism</em> as it relates to groups.
      Intuitively,
      two groups are isomorphic if any algebraic statement about one group is also true about the other,
      just expressed in different symbology.
      For example,
      given that group a finite group <m>G</m> is isomorphic to group <m>H</m>,
      it is then possible to obtain the Cayley table for <m>H</m> simply by making letter-for-letter substitutions in the Cayley table for <m>G</m>.

      The concept of isomorphism applies to other mathematical structures besides groups.
      A great deal of mathematics is concerned with showing that two apparently different mathematical structures are in fact the same,
      just expressed in different terminology.
      When the structures involved are rings, vector spaces,
      etc., then we may talk about ring isomorphisms,
      vector space isomorphisms, and so on.

      In this chapter, we will give an example of a
      <term>ring isomorphism</term>.
      This isomorphism is quite important in
      <term>digital signal processing</term>,is a key area of modern technology that powers our CD players,
      cell phones,
      wireless internet, and many other electronic devices.

      To understand this chapter you will need some background in linear algebra.
      In particular,
      you will need to understand algebraic operations on vectors and matrices.
      In the first section,
      we'll give a brief review of some basic properties of vectors and vector spaces.
