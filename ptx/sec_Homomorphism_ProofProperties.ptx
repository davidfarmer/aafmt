  <title>Proofs of homomorphism properties</title>
  <p>
    So it seems there are several properties of homomorphisms that have consistently held true in our examples so far.
    For any homomorphism <m>f</m> with domain <m>G</m> and the codomain <m>H</m>,
    it seems that:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The elements in <m>G</m> that map under <m>f</m> to the identity of <m>H</m> are in fact a normal subgroup of <m>G</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The quotient group created by that normal subgroup is then isomorphic to the image of the homomorphism.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> maps <m>g</m> to <m>h</m>,
          then <m>f</m> also maps <m>g^{-1}</m> to <m>h^{-1}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    These properties are indeed true for all homomorphisms,
    and we'll take the next two sections to prove these as well as other properties of homomorphisms.
    We begin with
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="proposition_Homomorphism_HomorphismSubgroupProp">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f : G \rightarrow H</m> be a homomorphism of groups.
        Then
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>e</m> is the identity of <m>G</m>,
              then <m>f( e)</m> is the identity of <m>H</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For any element <m>g \in G</m>,
              <m>f( g^{-1}) = [f( g )]^{- 1}</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>S</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
              then <m>f(S )</m> is a subgroup of <m>H</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li xml:id="normal_kernel">
            <p>
              If <m>T</m> is a subgroup of <m>H</m>,
              then <m>f^{-1}(T) = \{ g \in G : f(g) \in T \}</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
              Furthermore, if <m>T</m> is normal in <m>H</m>,
              then <m>f^{-1}(T)</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      (1) Suppose that <m>e</m> and <m>e'</m> are the identities of <m>G</m> and <m>H</m>,
      respectively.
      Then
      <me>
        e' f(e) = f(e) = f(e e) = f(e) f(e)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By cancellation, <m>f(e) = e'</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) This statement follows from the fact that
      <me>
        f( g^{-1}) f(g) = f(g^{-1} g) = f(e) = e
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) The set <m>f(S)</m> is nonempty since the identity of <m>T</m> is in <m>f(S)</m>.
      Suppose that <m>S</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> and let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be in <m>f(S)</m>.
      There exist elements <m>a,
      b \in S</m> such that <m>f(a) = x</m> and <m>f(b)=y</m>.
      Since
      <me>
        xy = f(a) f(b) = f(a b ) \in f(S)
      </me>,
      and
      <me>
        x^{-1} = f(a)^{-1} = f(a^{-1}) \in f(S)
      </me>,
      it follows that <m>f(S)</m> is a subgroup of <m>H</m>
      (since it is closed under the group operation and inverse).
    </p>
    <p>
      (4) Let <m>T</m> be a subgroup of <m>H</m> and define <m>S</m> to be <m>f^{-1}(T)</m>;
      that is, <m>S</m> is the set of all <m>g \in G</m> such that <m>f(g) \in T</m>.
      The identity is in <m>S</m> since <m>f(e) = e</m>.
      If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are in <m>S</m>,
      then <m>f(ab^{-1}) = f(a)[ f(b) ]^{-1}</m> is in <m>T</m> since <m>T</m> is a subgroup of <m>H</m>.
      Therefore, <m>ab^{-1} \in S</m> and <m>S</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
      If <m>T</m> is normal in <m>H</m>,
      we must show that <m>g^{-1} h g \in S</m> for <m>h \in S</m> and <m>g \in G_1</m>.
      But
      <me>
        f( g^{-1} h g) = [ f(g) ]^{-1} f( h ) f( g ) \in T
      </me>,
      since <m>T</m> is a normal subgroup of <m>H</m>.
      Therefore, <m>g^{-1}hg \in S</m>.
          <idx><h>Normal subgroup</h></idx>
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    Now that we have these properties down,
    we can use them to prove some other properties of homomorphisms.
    We know that homomorphisms preserve group operations,
    which suggests that homomorphisms may preserve other group properties as well.
    We'll look at two group properties in the next exercise.

  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Homomorphism_homo_abelian_cyclic">

              prove that <m>f(G)</m> is also abelian.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f : G \rightarrow H</m> is a group homomorphism and <m>G</m> is cyclic,
              prove that <m>f(G)</m> is also cyclic.

  <p>
    One of the patterns we saw in our examples that we haven't verified yet was that the elements in <m>G</m> that map to the identity of <m>H</m> formed a normal subgroup in <m>G</m>.
    We can now prove this in general, but first a definition:

        Suppose that we wish to determine all possible homomorphisms <m>f</m> from
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_7</m> to <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>.
        Since the kernel of <m>f</m> must be a subgroup of <m>{\mathbb Z}_7</m>,
        there are only two possible kernels,

        The image of a subgroup of
