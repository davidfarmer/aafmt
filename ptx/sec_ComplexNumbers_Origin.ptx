    <title>A number that can't be real (and we can prove it!)</title>
    <p>
      Way back in your first algebra class, you saw equations like:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>x^2 = 4</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>x^2 = 36</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>x^2 = 7</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      You also learned how to solve them either by hand,
      or using the <c>SQRT</c> button on a simple calculator.
      The solutions to these equations are
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>x = \pm 2</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>x = \pm 6</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>x = \pm 2.64575131106459\ldots</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      But what about equations like:
      <me>
        x^2 = -1
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Your simple calculator can't help you with that one!<fn>
      It's true that the fancier graphing calculators can handle it,
      but that's beside the point.
      </fn> If you try to take the square root of -1, the calculator will choke out <c>ERR OR</c> or some similar message of distress.
      But why does it do this?
      Doesn't <m>-1</m> have a square root?
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, we can prove mathematically that <m>-1</m> does not have a
      <em>real</em> square root.
      As proofs will play a very important part in this course,
      we'll spend some extra time and care explaining this first proof.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_ComplexNumbers_no_sqrt">
      <statement>

    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We give two proofs of this proposition.
        The first one explains all the details,
        while the second proof is more streamlined.
        It is the streamlined proof that you should try to imitate when you write up proofs for homework exercises.

      <p>
        <em>Long drawn-out proof of <xref ref="proposition_ComplexNumbers_no_sqrt">Proposition</xref>
        with all the gory details:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use a common proof technique called
        <em><em>proof by contradiction</em></em>.
            <idx><h>Proof by contradiction</h></idx>
        Here's how it goes:
      </p>
      <p>
        First we <em>suppose</em> that there exists a real number <em>a</em>
        such that <m>a^{2}=-1</m>.
        Now we know that any real number is either positive, or zero,
        or negative<m>-</m>there are no other possibilities.
        So we consider each of these three cases:
        <m>a>0</m>, or <m>a=0</m>, or <m>a\lt 0</m>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the case that <m>a>0</m> then
              <m>a^{2}= a\cdot a =</m> (<em>positive</em>)<m>\cdot</m>(<em>positive</em>) = a positive number
              (that is, <m>a^{2}>0</m>).
              But this couldn't possibly be true,
              because we have already supposed that <m>a^{2}=-1</m>:
              there's no way that <m>a^{2}>0</m> and
              <m>a^{2}=-1</m> can both be true at the same time!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the case that <m>a=0</m>, then <m>a^{2}=a\cdot a = (0)\cdot(0) = 0</m>.
              But <m>a^{2}=0</m> also contradicts our
              <em>supposition</em> that <m>a^{2}=-1</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the case that <m>a\lt 0</m>,
              then <m>a^{2}</m>= <m>a\cdot a</m> = (<em>negative</em>)<m>\cdot</m>(<em>negative</em>) = a positive number,
              so <m>a^{2}>0</m>.
              As in the first case, this contradicts our
              <em>supposition</em> that <m>a^{2}=-1</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        So no matter which of the three possible cases is true,
        we're still screwed:
        in every case, we always have a contradiction.
        We seem to have reached a dead end <mdash/> a logically impossible conclusion.
        So what's wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
        What's wrong is the <em>supposition</em>.
        It <em>must</em> be the case that the supposition is not true.
        Consequently, the statement
        <q>there exists a real number <em>a</em>
        such that <m>a^{2}=-1</m></q>
        must be <em>false</em>.
        In other words, <m>-1</m> has no real square root.
        This completes the proof.
        <m>\square</m><fn>
        The '<m>\square</m>' symbol will be used to indicate the end of a proof.
        In other words: Ta-da!
        </fn>
      </p>
      <p>
        The above proof is pretty wordy.
        Often the first draft of a proof can be pretty messy.
        So it's usually good to go back and rewrite the proof in such a way as to bring out the essential details.
        Here's our second crack at the above proof:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Streamlined proof of <xref ref="proposition_ComplexNumbers_no_sqrt">Proposition</xref>
        (suitable for writing up homework exercises)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The proof is by contradiction.
        Suppose <m>\exists \emph{a} \in \mathbb{R}</m> such that <m>a^{2}=-1</m>
        (note the symbol
        <q><m>\exists</m></q>
        means
        <q>there exists,</q>
        the symbol <m>\mathbb{R}</m> denotes the real numbers,
        and the expression
        <q><m>\emph{a} \in \mathbb{R}</m></q>
        means that <m>a</m> is contained in <m>\mathbb{R}</m>,
        that is, <m>a</m> is a real number).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two cases: either (i) <m>a\geq0</m> or (ii) <m>a\lt 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Case (i), then <m>a^{2}</m>=
        <em><m>a\cdot a</m> =</em>
        (<em>nonnegative</em>)<m>\cdot</m>(<em>nonnegative</em>) <m>\geqq0</m>,
        which contradicts the supposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Case (ii), then <m>a^{2}</m>=
        <em><m>a\cdot a</m> =</em>
        (<em>negative</em>)<m>\cdot</m>(<em>negative</em>) <m>>0</m>,
        which contradicts the supposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contradiction, it follows that <m>-1</m> has no real square root.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      You may note that in the streamlined case,
      we reduced the number of cases from three to two.
      That's because we noticed that we really could combine the
      <q>positive</q>
      and the
      <q>zero</q>
      case into a single case.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far we've only considered square roots,
      but naturally we may ask the same questions about cube roots,
      fourth roots,
      and so on:

    <title>Unreal, but unavoidable</title>
    <p>
      Mathematicians have known <xref ref="proposition_ComplexNumbers_no_sqrt">Proposition</xref> for thousands of years,
      and for a long time that settled the question.
      Unfortunately,
      that nasty <m>\sqrt{-1}</m> kept popping up in all sorts of inconvenient places.
      For example, about 400 years ago,
      it was very fashionable to study the roots of cubic polynomials such as <m>x^{3}-15x-4=0</m>.
      A mathematician named Bombelli came up with a formula for a solution that eventually simplified to:
      <m>x = (2 + \sqrt{-1}) + (2 - \sqrt{-1})</m>.
      By canceling out the <m>\sqrt{-1}</m> terms,
      he got the correct solution <m>x=4</m>.
      But how can you cancel something that doesn't exist?
    </p>
    <p>
      Since mathematicians couldn't completely avoid those embarrassing
      <m>\sqrt{-1}</m>'s, they decided to put up with them as best they could.
      They called <m>\sqrt{-1}</m> an
      <em>imaginary</em> number,
          <idx><h>Imaginary number</h></idx>
      just to emphasize that it wasn't up to par with the <em>real</em> numbers.
      They also used the symbol <m>i</m> to represent <m>\sqrt{-1}</m>,
      to make it less conspicuous
      (and easier to write).
      Finally, they created a larger set of numbers that included both real and imaginary numbers,
      called the <em>complex numbers.</em><idx><h>Complex numbers</h><h>definition of</h></idx>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec_ComplexNumbers_Origin_MathRevolution">
    <title>A mathematical revolution</title>
    <p>
      The creation of complex numbers was a revolutionary event in the history of mathematics.
      Mathematicians were forced to recognize that their beloved
      <q>real</q>
      numbers just weren't good enough to deal with the mathematical problems they were encountering.
      So they had to create a <em>new</em> <em>number system</em>
      (the complex numbers)
      with<em>new</em> symbols (<m>i</m>) and
      <em>new</em> arithmetic rules
      (like <m>i\cdot i=-1</m>).
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, this was not the first time that a controversial new number system was founded.
      The ancient Greeks thought that all numbers could be expressed as a ratio of integers
      <m>\frac{m}{n}</m> <mdash/> in other words,
      the Greeks thought all numbers were rational.
      It came as a huge shock when someone proved that some real numbers are <em>not</em> rational.
      We will presently give the original proof,
      but first we will need some properties of odd and even integers:

        <p>
          Given a right isosceles triangle where both legs have length 1
          (see <xref ref="fig_ComplexNumbers_isosceles_right">Figure</xref>)
          . Let <m>x</m> be the length of the hypotenuse.
          Then <m>x</m> is irrational<ndash/>that is,
          it cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers.
              <idx><h>Irrational number</h><h>definition of</h></idx>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The proof is by contradiction.
            <idx><h>Irrational number</h><h>existence proof</h></idx>
        <em>Suppose</em> that <m>x</m> is rational:
        that is, <m>x = \frac{m}{n}</m> for some integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>.We can always reduce a fraction to lowest terms ( as noted in <xref ref="subsec_Preliminaries_EqsAndIneqs">Section</xref>),
        so we can assume <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> have no common factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>x</m> is the hypotenuse of a right triangle,
        the Pythagorean Theorem gives us <m>x^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2</m>.
        We can plug <m>x=\frac{m}{n}</m> into <m>x^2 = 2</m> to get <m>\left(\frac{m}{n}\right) ^2 = 2</m>,
        which can be rearranged to give
        <me>
          m^2 = 2n^2
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this we see that <m>m^2</m> is divisible by 2, which means that <m>m^2</m> is even.
        <xref ref="exercise_ComplexNumbers_m2even">Exercise</xref>
        part (b) then tells us that <m>m</m> is even,
        so there must be an integer <m>j</m> such that <m>m = 2j</m>.
        Plugging <m>m=2j</m> into <m>m^2=2n^2</m> gives <m>4j^2 = 2n^2</m>,
        which simplifies to <m>2j^2 = n^2</m>.
        Hence <m>n^2</m> is even, and as before we conclude that <m>n</m> is even.
        So <m>n = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, we have <m>m = 2j</m> and <m>n = 2k</m>,
        which means that <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> have a common factor of 2.
        But at the beginning of the proof,
        we said that <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> were reduced to lowest terms,
        so they have no common factor.
        This is a contradiction.
        Therefore our <em>supposition</em> must be false,
        so <m>x</m> cannot be rational.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      We have seen in our proofs that whenever we make a statement,
      we also need to give a reason that justifies the statement.

      Note that the preceding proof amounts to a proof that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational,
      since we know that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is the length of the hypothesis in question.
      Given the results of <xref ref="exercise_ComplexNumbers_m2even">Exercise</xref>,
      we can use a similar proof to find more irrational numbers.

      In the proof of <xref ref="proposition_ComplexNumbers_irrational">Proposition</xref>, we

      or substituted one expression for another.
      For example,
      when we discovered that <m>m</m> was divisible by 2 we substituted <m>2j</m> for <m>m</m>,
      which was useful for the algebra that followed.

      We should also come clean and admit that our proof of <xref ref="proposition_ComplexNumbers_irrational">Proposition</xref>
      falls short of true mathematical rigor.
      The reason is that we made use of <xref ref="exercise_ComplexNumbers_m2even">Exercise</xref>,
      and we never actually proved part (a) of the exercise.
      Even though it's something that
      <q>everybody knows</q>, mathematicians still want a proof!
      Now, part (a) is a consequence of a more general proposition known as
      <term>Euclid's Lemma</term>:.
          <idx><h>Euclid's lemma</h></idx>
      Before giving this lemma, let's be precise about what we mean by
      <q>prime number</q>:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {defPrime} A <em>prime number</em>
              <idx><h>Prime</h><h>definition</h></idx>
          is a natural number (i.e. positive integer) bigger than 1 that only has one factor bigger than 1, namely itself.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Now we are ready to state Euclid's lemma:

    <proposition xml:id="proposition_ComplexNumbers_EuclidLemma">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers,

          If <m>p</m> divides <m>ab</m>,
          then either <m>p</m> divides <m>a</m>,
          or <m>p</m> divides <m>b</m>.

        <remark>

            In mathematics, when we say

            or <m>p</m> divides <m>b</m></q>, it's possible that <m>p</m> divides both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.

      The inconvenient truth expressed in <xref ref="proposition_ComplexNumbers_irrational">Proposition</xref>
      forced mathematicians to extend the 'real' numbers to include <em>irrational</em>
      as well as <em>rational</em> numbers.
      But complex numbers opened the floodgates by setting a precedent.
      New generations of mathematicians became so used to working with
      <q>unreal</q>
      numbers that they became accustomed to making up other number systems whenever it suited their purpose.
      Within a few centuries after the complex numbers,
      several new number systems were created.
      This eventually prompted mathematicians to study the properties of general numbers systems.
      The outcome of this is what is known today as abstract algebra!
