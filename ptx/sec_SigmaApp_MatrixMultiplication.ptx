  <title>Matrix multiplication</title>
  <p>
    It should come as no surprise that summation notation commonly shows up when working with matrices.
    In the following discussion,
    we will follow the common practice of denoting a matrix with a capital letter in italics,
    and the entries of the matrix with the same letter in lowercase.
    Thus for example,
    <m>a_{2,4}</m> denotes the entry of matrix <m>A</m> in row 2, column 4.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider the example of multiplying the
    <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix <m>A</m> and the <m>3 \times 2</m> matrix <m>B</m>.
    <me>
      {A}{B} = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} a_{1,1} \amp  a_{1,2}  \amp  a_{1,3}  \\ a_{2,1} \amp  a_{2,2} \amp  a_{2,3} \\ a_{3,1} \amp  a_{3,2} \amp  a_{3,3} \end{array}  \right) \left( \begin{array}{cc} b_{1,1} \amp  b_{1,2}    \\ b_{2,1} \amp  b_{2,2}  \\ b_{3,1} \amp  b_{3,2} \end{array}  \right)
    </me>
    <me>
      = \left( \begin{array}{cc} a_{1,1} b_{1,1} + a_{1,2} b_{2,1} + a_{1,3} b_{3,1} \amp  a_{1,1} b_{1,2} + a_{1,2} b_{2,2} + a_{1,3} b_{3,2}  \\ a_{2,1} b_{1,1} + a_{2,2} b_{2,1} + a_{2,3} b_{3,1} \amp  a_{2,1} b_{1,2} + a_{2,2} b_{2,2} + a_{2,3} b_{3,2}  \\ a_{3,1} b_{1,1} + a_{3,2} b_{2,1} + a_{3,3} b_{3,1} \amp  a_{3,1} b_{1,2} + a_{3,2} b_{2,2} + a_{3,3} b_{3,2} \end{array}  \right)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Wouldn't it be nice if we could shorten that mess?
    Fortunately we can!
    Let the matrix <m>{C}</m> be the product <m>{A} {B}</m>,
    where <m>{A}</m> is an <m>m ~\times ~n</m> matrix and <m>{B}</m> is an
    <m>n ~\times ~p</m> matrix , which implies that the dimensions of <m>{C}</m> will be <m>m ~ \times ~ p</m>.<fn>
    Remember the requirement for multiplying any two matrices is that the number of columns of the first must match the number of rows of the second.
    </fn> If the row number is given by the first index
    (in this case <m>i</m>),
    and the column number is given by the second index
    (in this case <m>j</m>),
    we can write the entries of <m>{C}</m> as:
    <me>
      {c}_{i,j}= \sum_{k=1}^n a_{i,k} b_{k,j}
    </me>
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In the above formula,
        both <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> are restricted to a particular range of values.
        What are the possible values of <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    Let's show how this formula works in a specific case.
    Suppose <m>{A}</m> is a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix and <m>{B}</m> is a
    <m>3 \times 2</m> matrix as in our previous example,
    then the result of the product <m>{A} {B}</m> is a
    <m>3 \times 2</m> matrix that we can call <m>{C}</m>.
    Now suppose we want to find the entry on the third row in the second column of <m>{C}</m>,
    then we would compute:
    <md>
      <mrow>{c}_{3,2} =\amp  \sum_{k=1}^3 a_{3,k} b_{k,2}</mrow>
      <mrow>=\amp  a_{3,1} b_{1,2} + a_{3,2} b_{2,2} + a_{3,3} b_{3,2}</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sure enough,
    when we look at the long version we wrote earlier for the product <m>{AB}</m> our result matches the entry on the second row,
    third column.
  </p>
  <p>
    The above formula makes it possible to calculate individual matrix elements,
    without having to compute the entire matrix.
