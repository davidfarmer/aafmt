    (a): If there is a double root , then it must be that <m>0 = x^3 + ax + b</m> has a double root.
    This means that the equation can be factored:
    <m>x^3 + ax+b = (x-r_1)^2(x-r_2)</m>.
    Express <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in terms of <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>. (A similar approach can be used in the case of a triple root.)

    (b): There are 2 cases: (i) <m>b=0</m>, (ii) <m>b \neq 0</m>.
    In the case <m>b \neq 0</m>, first, show that <m>a > 0</m>.
    Then use part (a) to express <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m> in terms of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
    and show the equation factors properly.
