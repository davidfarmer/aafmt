        <em>Number of subsets with an even
        (or odd)
        number of elements:</em> Using induction,
        prove that an <m>n</m>-element set has <m>2^{n-1}</m> subsets with an even number of elements and <m>2^{n-1}</m> subsets with an odd number of elements.
      </p>

        <em>Number of regions created by <m>n</m> lines:</em>
        How many regions are created by <m>n</m> lines in the plane such that no two lines are parallel and no three lines intersect at the same point?
        Guess the answer from the first few cases,
        then use induction to prove your guess.

        <em>Sum of angles in a polygon:</em>
        The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is <m>180</m> degrees,
        or <m>\pi</m>.
        Using this result and induction,
        prove that for any <m>n\ge3</m>,
        the sum of the interior angles in an <m>n</m>-sided polygon is <m>(n-2)\pi</m>.

        <em>Pie-throwing problem:</em> Here is a harder, but fun problem.
        Consider a group of <m>n</m> fraternity members standing in a yard,
        such that their mutual distances are all distinct.
        Suppose each of throws a pie at his nearest neighbor.
        Show that if <m>n</m> is odd,
        then there is one person in the group who does not get hit by a pie.
        (<em>Hint</em>: Let <m>n=2m+1</m> with <m>m\in\NN</m>,
        and use <m>m</m> as the induction variable.
        Consider first some small cases,
        e.g., <m>n=3</m> and <m>n=5</m>.)
