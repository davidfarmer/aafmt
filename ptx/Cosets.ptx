    <p>
      <em>Shrek</em> For your information,
      there's a lot more to ogres than people think.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Donkey</em> Example?
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Shrek</em> Example... uh... ogres are like onions!
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Donkey</em> They stink?
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Shrek</em> Yes... No!
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Donkey</em> Oh, they make you cry?
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Shrek</em> No!
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Donkey</em> Oh, you leave 'em out in the sun,
      they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs...
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Shrek</em> NO! Layers.
      Onions have layers.
      Ogres have layers... You get it?
      We both have layers.

    <p>
      Groups, like onions and ogres, also have layers.
      As we've seen, many groups have subgroups inside them.
      These subgroups can be used to define
      <q>layers</q>
      which are called <em>cosets</em>.
      And in some cases, the
      <q>layers</q>
      (cosets) themselves form groups,
      which are called <em>quotient groups</em>
      (or <em>factor groups</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Our examination of cosets will give us deep insight into the nature and structure of groups.
      We will be leaning heavily on the material from <xref ref="ModularArithmetic">Chapter</xref>
      (which will furnish us with motivating examples),
      <xref ref="EquivalenceRelations">Chapter</xref>
      (which will aid us in our characterization of cosets),
      and of course <xref ref="Groups">Chapter</xref>.
      In the course of reading this chapter,
      you may want to review these chapters.
      So, here we go!
