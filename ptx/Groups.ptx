      You may have noticed that we have been voyaging deeper and deeper into unfamiliar mathematical territory.
      We're using more symbols and fewer numbers.
      We introduce unfamiliar terminology and strange notation.
      We deal with outlandish mathematical objects that are harder and harder to visualize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please rest assured that these elaborations have a practical purpose<fn>
      (that is, besides tormenting math students)
      </fn>.
      We live in a complicated world,
      and complicated mathematical structures are needed to describe it well.
      However, underlying this confusing tangle of complicated structures are some deep commonalities.
      The purpose of abstraction is to identify and characterize these commonalities.
      In this way we can make connections between very different fields of mathematics,
      and gain a much more holistic view of how things work together.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the commonalities that we have been
      (more or less)
      subtly emphasizing in the previous chapters is the ubiquity of <em>groups</em>,
      together with related notions such as isomorphisms and subgroups.
      Now that you've studies several specific groups
      (such as <m>{\mathbb C}, {\mathbb Z}_n, D_n, S_n, A_n</m> and so on)
      our hope is that from these examples you've begun to get a feel for how groups work,
      and how one should think about groups in general.
      In this chapter, we will study groups
      <em>in the abstract</em>:
      that is, we will describe properties that are common to <em>all</em> groups,
      whether finite or infinite, commutative (abelian) or non-abelian,
      and so on.
