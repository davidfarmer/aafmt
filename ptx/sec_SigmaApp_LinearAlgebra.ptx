    Linear algebra is the algebra of real space:
    not just 3-dimensional space,
    but <m>n</m>-dimensional generalizations.
    The important mathematical objects in linear algebra are vectors and matrices: You may remember that matrices represent functions (transformations) that act on vectors.
    Although linear algebra is a relatively recent field of mathematics
    (which got its start in the mid-1800's),
    since the advent of computers it has risen to the <sq>top of the heap</sq> so to speak,
    so that most modern applications of mathematics to real-world problems are built on linear algebra.

    Sigma notation is a powerful notational tool for expressing relations and proving identities in linear algebra.
    In this chapter,
    we will look at some of the ways that sigma notation can be used to prove properties of vectors and matrices in three-dimensional space.
    These properties are basic to in the physics of moving objects and fields.

    This chapter ties together material from several chapters in the book.
    Besides sigma notation, we need concepts from sets, functions,
    and just a little bit from permutations
    (we'll give the background you need in this chapter).
    To understand the chapter,
    the reader should already have seen vectors and matrices
    (up to size <m>3\times 3</m>)
    and know a little bit about how they work.

    In the following discussions,
    we will assume that all matrices have real entries.
    However, all of the results that we will prove also apply
    (in some cases, with slight modifications)
    for matrices with <em>complex</em> entries,
    or matrices with entries in <m>\mathbb{Z}_p</m>.
