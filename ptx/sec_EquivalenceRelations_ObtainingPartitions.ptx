      tells us that given any partition <m>\mathcal{P}</m> of a set <m>S</m>,
      we can define an equivalence relation which says that two elements of <m>S</m> are equivalent iff they belong to the same set in the partition.
      We'll see in this section that we can go the other way as well:
      namely, given any equivalence relation on <m>S</m> we can construct a partition on <m>S</m> which divided all the elements of <m>S</m> among disjoint subsets.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make this work, we first must define a key notion:
      <em>equivalence classes</em>.
      Here we go!

  <subsection xml:id="subsec_EquivalenceRelations_ObtainingPartitions_RelationToClass">
    <title>From equivalence relations to equivalence classes</title>
    <p>
      Let's ramp up to our key definition by means of an example.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we're studying a set of people,
          and we're only interested in their given names.
          Of course there may be several Johns,
          several Marys, a couple of Sylvesters,
          and so on<ndash/> but as far as given names are concerned,
          any two Johns can be considered as equivalent:
          indeed, we formalized this sense of equivalence in <xref ref="example_EquivalenceRelations_MoreEquivRelEgs">Example</xref>(b).
          We can group all Johns into a single set or class,
          which we'll refer to as an <em>equivalence class</em>.
          We can do the same thing with Marys, Sylvesters, Xyleenas, Zenobias,
          and so on.
          It follows that every person in the set belongs to her or his own equivalence class (even if the equivalence class consists of a single person!)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Let's generalize this example.
      Essentially,
      the only fact about given names that we used to define equivalence classes was that given name defines an equivalence relation on the set of interest.
      So it stands to reason that we can do something similar with any equivalence relation:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {DefEquivRel} Suppose <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on a set<nbsp/><m>A</m>.
          For each <m>a \in A</m>, the <term>equivalence class</term>
              <idx><h>Equivalence class</h></idx>
          of<nbsp/><m>a</m> is the following subset of<nbsp/><m>A</m>:
          <me>
            [a] = \{\, s \in A \mid s \sim a \,\}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is, the equivalence class of the element <m>a \in A</m> is the set of all elements of <m>A</m> that are equivalent to <m>a</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For the equivalence relation<nbsp/><m>N</m> described in <xref ref="example_EquivalenceRelations_MoreEquivRelEgs">Example</xref>(b), we have
          <me>
            [\var{Woodrow\,\,Wilson}] = \{\, x \in \var{People} \mid \var{GivenName}(x) = \var{GivenName}(\var{Woodrow\,\,Wilson}) \,\}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words,
          <m>[\var{Woodrow\,\,Wilson}]</m> is the set of all people whose given name is Woodrow.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <warning>
      <p>
        The notation <m>[a]</m> does not tell us which equivalence relation is being used.
        You should be able to figure out which relation it is from the context.
      </p>
    </warning>
    <p>
      Let's give a a more
      <q>mathy</q>

    <title>From equivalence classes to partitions</title>
    <p>
      It's time to come full circle,
      and show that partitions arise from equivalence classes.
      As in the previous section, we'll ramp up with an example.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_EquivalenceRelations_EquivClassPartEg">

          Since <m>1,2,3,4,5</m> each belong to exactly one of these sets,
          we see that the set

      equivalence classes resulting from an equivalence relation on <m>S</m> will always break <m>S</m> up into disjoint sets which,
      taken together, include all the elements of <m>S</m>.
      We've seen this description before<ndash/>this is exactly what a partition does.

      We close this section with an exercise that reinforces the idea that partitions and equivalence classes are really two different ways of looking at the same thing.

          We know from <xref ref="proposition_EquivalenceRelations_parteqrel">Proposition</xref>
          that any partition produces an equivalence relation.
          We also know from <xref ref="proposition_EquivalenceRelations_EquivRel-_Part">Proposition</xref>
          that any equivalence relation produces a partition.

                Suppose we begin with a partition <m>\mathcal{P}</m> on the set <m>A</m>,
                and define an equivalence relation
                <m>\sim_{\mathcal{P}}</m> as in <xref ref="proposition_EquivalenceRelations_parteqrel">Proposition</xref>.
                Next, suppose that following <xref ref="proposition_EquivalenceRelations_EquivRel-_Part">Proposition</xref>
                we define a partition <m>\mathcal{P}'</m> consisting of the equivalence classes of <m>\sim_{\mathcal{P}}</m>.

                (One way to do this is to show that every set in
