  <title>The dihedral groups</title>
  <p>
    We have investigated the symmetries of equilateral triangle,
    square, and regular hexagon.
    But what about other regular polygons:
    heptagon, octagon, nonagon, decagon,
    and so on? (Recall from geometry that a
    <term>regular polygon</term>
        <idx><h>Polygon</h><h>regular</h></idx>
    has all sides equal and all angles equal.) In this section,
    we will take a general look at the symmetries of <m>n</m>-sided regular polygons.
  </p>
  <p>
    We already know from <xref ref="exercise_Symmetry_group_proof">Exercise</xref>
    that the symmetries of any n-sided regular polygon form a group.
    We define the <term> <m>n</m>th dihedral group</term>
        <idx><h>Group</h><h>dihedral</h></idx>
    to be the group of symmetries of a regular <m>n</m>-gon.
    We will denote this group by <m>D_n</m> .

  <p>
    Let us try to count the number of elements of <m>D_n</m> . We can number the vertices of a regular <m>n</m>-gon by <m>1, 2, \ldots, n</m>
    (<xref ref="rotations">Figure</xref>).
    Any symmetry will move the <m>n</m>-gon so that each vertex is replaced by another vertex.
    Notice that any vertex can replace the first vertex:
    so there are exactly <m>n</m> choices to replace the first vertex.
    Suppose we replace vertex 1 by vertex <m>k</m>:
    then vertex 2 must be replaced either by vertex <m>k+1</m> or by vertex <m>k-1</m>,
    because these are the only vertices next to vertex <m>k</m>.
    So for each of the <m>n</m> choices for replacing vertex 1, there are two choices for replacing vertex 2:
    which makes <m>2n</m> possible choices altogether.
    If you think about it,
    you'll see that once the replacements for vertices 1 and 2 are determined,
    the entire symmetry is fixed
    (again, because vertices must remain next to each other).
    We summarize our conclusion in the following proposition.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The dihedral group, <m>D_n</m>,
        is a group of order <m>2n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    Let us try to characterize these <m>2n</m> elements of the dihedral group <m>D_n</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, we know that the elements of the dihedral group includes <m>n</m> rotations:
    <me>
      {\var id}, \frac{360^{\circ} }{n}, 2 \cdot \frac{360^{\circ} }{n}, \ldots, (n-1) \cdot \frac{360^{\circ} }{n}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will denote the rotation <m>360^{\circ} /n</m> by <m>r</m>.
    Notice that:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>r \compose r =</m> rotation by <m>2 \cdot \frac{360^{\circ} }{n}</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>r \compose r \compose r =</m> rotation by <m>3 \cdot \frac{360^{\circ} }{n}</m>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    We can generalize this pattern by writing:
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>r^k = \mbox{ rotation by } k \cdot \frac{360^{\circ} }{n}~~~(k=1,2,3,\ldots)</m>,
  </p>
  <p>
    where the notation <m>r^k</m> means that we compose <m>r</m> with itself <m>k</m> times:
    <m>r \compose r \ldots \compose r</m>.
    We can also continue this pattern with <m>k=0</m> and write:
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>r^0 = \mbox{ rotation by } 0 \cdot \frac{360^{\circ} }{n} = \var{id}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also have
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>r^n = \mbox{ rotation by } n \cdot \frac{360^{\circ} }{n} = \mbox{ rotation by } 360^{\circ} = {\var id}</m>,
  </p>
  <p>
    since rotation by 360 degrees is tantamount to not moving the figure at all.
  </p>

      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p>
            Using the above definition of <m>r^k</m>,

      </ol>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    From the above discussion,
    it should be clear that the <m>n</m> rotations in <m>D_n</m> can be expressed as:
    <me>
      {\var id}, r, r^2, \ldots, r^{n-1}
    </me>,
    where we have included <m>{\var id}</m> since it is
    <q>rotation by 0 degrees</q>
    (as mentioned above,
    we could also write <m>\var{id}</m> as <m>r^0</m>).
    This gives us a nice way of characterizing the rotations in <m>D_n</m>.
    But until now we don't have a nice way of writing the reflections.
    We'll take care of that now!
  </p>
  <p>
    We have labeled the vertices of the <m>n</m>-gon as <m>1,2,\ldots,n</m>.
    In the following discussion,
    we will use the letter <m>s</m> to denote the reflection that leaves the vertex labeled 1 <em>fixed</em>,
    that is, <m>s(1) = 1</m>.<fn>
    In math books you may also find the termi
    <q>invariant</q>
    instead of
    <q>fixed</q>.
    </fn> Another way of saying the same thing is:
    the vertex labeled 1 is
    <q>fixed by</q>
    <m>s</m>.

    By generalizing the arguments used in the preceding exercises,
    it is possible to prove for any <m>n</m> that:
    <me>
      s^2 = {\var id}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we have already shown there are <m>n</m> distinct rotations.
    Suppose we follow each of these rotations by the reflection <m>s</m>:
    that is, consider the set
    <me>
      S \equiv \{s \compose {\var id}, s \compose r, s \compose r^2, \ldots, s \compose r^{n-1}\}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    It appears that <m>S</m> has <m>n</m> elements:
    but are these elements distinct?
    The following exercise provides an answer:

  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Symmetry_32">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove the following proposition by filling in the blanks:

      <p>
        <em>Proposition.</em> If <m>0\lt p,q \lt n</m> and <m>p \neq q</m>,
        then <m>s \compose r^p</m> and

        that is, <m>s\circ r^p \neq s \compose r^q</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The proof is by contradiction.
            Given <m>0\lt p,q \lt n</m> and <m>p \neq q</m>,
            and suppose that <m>s \compose r^p \underline{~\lt 1>~} s \compose r^q</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Compose both sides of the equation with <m>s</m>, and obtain the equation:
            <m>s \compose (s \compose r^p) = \underline{~\lt 2>~}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            By the associative property of composition, this can be rewritten:
            <m>(s \compose s) \compose \underline{~\lt 3>~} = \underline{~\lt 4>~}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>s \compose s = \underline{~\lt 5>~}</m>, this can be rewritten:
            <m>{\var id} \compose \underline{~\lt 6>~} = \underline{~\lt 7>~}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>{\var id}</m> is a group identity, we have:
            <m>r^p = \underline{~\lt 8>~}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            But we have already shown that <m>r^p</m> and <m>r^q</m> are distinct symmetries if <m>0\lt p,q \lt n</m> and <m>p \neq q</m>.
            This is a contradiction.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Therefore we conclude that our supposition was incorrect,
            and <m>s \compose r^p \underline{~\lt 9>~} s \compose r^q</m>.
            This completes the proof.
