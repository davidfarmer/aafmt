    The message to be sent is called the <term> plaintext</term>
        <idx><h>Plaintext</h></idx>
    message.
    The disguised message is called the <term>ciphertext</term>.
        <idx><h>Ciphertext</h></idx>
    The plaintext and the ciphertext are both written in an <term>alphabet</term>,
    consisting of <term> letters</term>
    or <term>characters</term>.
    Characters can include not only the familiar alphabetic characters A, <m>\ldots</m>, Z and a, <m>\ldots</m>,
    z but also digits, punctuation marks, and blanks.

    has two parts: <term>encryption</term>,
        <idx><h>Encryption</h><h>definition</h></idx>
    the process of transforming a plaintext message to a ciphertext message,
    and <term> decryption</term>,
        <idx><h>Decryption</h><h>definition</h></idx>
    the reverse transformation of changing a ciphertext message into a plaintext message.

    There are many different families of cryptosystems,
    each distinguished by a particular encryption algorithm.
    Cryptosystems in a specified cryptographic family are distinguished from one another by a variable parameter called a <term>key</term>.
        <idx><h>Key</h><h>definition of</h></idx>
    A classical cryptosystem has a single key,
    which must be kept secret,
    known only to the sender and the receiver of the message.
    If person <m>A</m> wishes to send secret messages to two different people <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>,
    and does not wish to have <m>B</m> understand <m>C</m>'s messages or vice versa,
    <m>A</m> must use two separate keys,
    so one cryptosystem is used for exchanging messages with <m>B</m>,
    and another is used for exchanging messages with <m>C</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some systems use two separate keys,
    one for encoding and another for decoding.
    These are called <term>public key cryptosystems</term>
        <idx><h>Key</h><h>public</h></idx>,
        <idx><h>Cryptosystem</h><h>public key</h></idx>
    because typically the encoding key is made public while the decoding key is kept secret.
    A public key cryptosystem allows <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> to send messages to <m>C</m> using the same encoding key.
    Anyone is capable of encoding a message to be sent to <m>C</m>,
    but only <m>C</m> knows how to decode such a message.

    On the other hand, in <term>single</term>
        <idx><h>Key</h><h>single</h></idx>
        <idx><h>Cryptosystem</h><h>single key</h></idx>
    or <term>private key cryptosystems</term>
        <idx><h>Key</h><h>private</h></idx>
        <idx><h>Cryptosystem</h><h>private key</h></idx>
    the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting messages.
    To encrypt a plaintext message,
    we apply to the message procedure which transforms a plaintext message into an encrypted message.
    We will call this procedure an <term>encryption function</term><idx><h>Encryption</h><h>function</h></idx>,
        <idx><h>Function</h><h>encryption</h></idx>
    and denote it by the letter <m>f</m>.
    Given the encrypted form of the message,
    we can recover the original message by applying the
    <term>decryption function</term><idx><h>Decryption</h><h>function</h></idx>
        <idx><h>Function</h><h>decryption</h></idx> <m>f^{-1}</m>, which basically undoes the transformation performed by the encryption function.<fn>
    In fact, <m>f^{-1}</m> is the <em>inverse</em><idx><h>Inverse function</h><h>in cryptography</h></idx> of <m>f</m><ndash/>we will study inverse functions in general in <xref ref="Functions">Chapter</xref>.
    </fn> Both the encryption function <m>f</m> and the decryption function <m>f^{-1}</m> must be relatively easy to compute;
    however, they must be virtually impossible to guess if only examples of coded messages are available.

    In <xref ref="sec_Cryptography_PrivateKey">Section</xref>
    we will look at private key cryptography,
    beginning with a classic example from antiquity.
    In <xref ref="sec_Cryptography_PublicKey">Section</xref>
    we will look at a famous example of a public key cryptosystem,
    which was only discovered in the last century and has had an enormous impact on information security in the digital age.
