    <xref ref="exercise_Symmetry_mercedes">Exercise</xref>: The rearrangement that doesn't move anything is still considered to be a symmetry:
    for obvious reasons, it is called the <term>identity</term>).

    <xref ref="exercise_Symmetry_prop_proof">Exercise</xref>: The proof is very similar to part (ii) of the same proposition.
  </p>
