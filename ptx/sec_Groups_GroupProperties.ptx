  <title>Basic properties of groups</title>
  <p>
    Now that we have a general definition of groups,
    we can use this definition to prove properties that are true of <em>all</em> groups.
    We'll begin by proving some essential properties that we've shown for specific groups,
    but need to know in general:
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="proposition_Groups_id_unique">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The identity element in a group <m>G</m> is unique;
        that is, there exists only one element <m>e \in G</m> such that
        <m>eg = ge = g</m> for all <m>g \in G</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <remark>
    <p>
      The following proof follows the classic format used to prove that something is unique:
      assume instead there are two of them,
      then either derive a contradiction or show that the two things are really equal.
      We will employ the latter.
    </p>
  </remark>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose that <m>e</m> and <m>e'</m> are both identities in <m>G</m>.
      Then <m>eg = ge = g</m> and
      <m>e'g = ge' = g</m> for all <m>g \in G</m>.
      We need to show that <m>e = e'</m>.
      If we think of <m>e</m> as the identity, then <m>ee' = e'</m>;
      but if <m>e'</m> is the identity, then <m>ee' = e</m>.
      Combining these two equations,
      we have <m>e = ee' = e'</m>.

    An important property of inverses is:

        Let <m>G</m> be a group.

  <remark>
    <p>
      We've actually seen this property before,
      in the permutations chapter:
      recall that for two permutations <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m>,
      we showed that <m>(\sigma \tau)^{-1} = \tau^{-1} \sigma^{-1}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the inverse property, <m>\exists a^{-1}, b^{-1} \in G</m>.
      By the closure property, <m>ab \in G</m> and <m>b^{-1}a^{-1} \in G</m>.
      So we only need to verify that
      <m>b^{-1}a^{-1}</m> satisfies the definition of inverse

      we know the inverse is unique).

    By repeated application of <xref ref="proposition_Groups_group_inv_reverse">Proposition</xref>,
    we may find the inverse of the product of multiple group elements,
    for example:
    <m>(abcd)^{-1} = d^{-1}c^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="proposition_Groups_group_inv_reverse">Proposition</xref> shows that in general,
    when finding inverses of products it is necessary to take the products of inverses in reverse order.
    One might ask, Is it ever the case that it's not necessary to reverse the order?
    Glad you asked!
    We address this question in the following exercise:

    now we shall characterize the inverse of an inverse.
    From ordinary algebra we know that
    <m>-(-a) = a</m> and <m>1/(1/a) = a</m>.
    This generalizes to arbitrary groups as follows:
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="proposition_Groups_inv_inv">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a group.

    <p>
      If <m>a \in G</m>, then since <m>G</m> is a group,

      And again, since <m>G</m> is a group,
      there also exists <m>(a^{-1})^{-1} \in G</m>.

    <p>
      Now, by the definition of inverse,
      <m>a^{-1} (a^{-1})^{-1} = e</m>.

    In high school algebra we wrote equations like <m>6 + x = -\sqrt{2}</m> or <m>5x = 6</m>,
    and we could always find a real number <m>x</m> that was a solution.
    Now we know that <m>{\mathbb R}</m> is a group under addition and multiplication.
    Similarly, we have seen that equations like
    <m>ax = b \pmod{n}</m> and <m>a + x = b \pmod{n}</m> had solutions for
    <m>x \in U(n)</m> and <m>x \in {\mathbb Z}_n</m>, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    Noticing a pattern here, the question then is this:
    does the equation <m>ax = b</m> have a solution for any group <m>G</m>?
    In other words,
    if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are two elements in a group <m>G</m>,
    does there exist an element <m>x \in G</m> such that <m>ax = b</m>?
    If such an <m>x</m> does exist, is it unique?
    The following proposition answers both of these questions affirmatively.
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="proposition_Groups_group_equations">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be any two elements in <m>G</m>.
        Then the equations <m>ax = b</m> and <m>xa = b</m> have unique solutions in <m>G</m>.

    Note we need separate proofs to show that <m>x</m> exists and is unique for both <m>ax =b</m> and <m>xa = b</m>,
    since we don't know whether the group is abelian.
    The proof for <m>ax=b</m> is a fill-in-the-blank exercise,
    while the proof for <m>xa=b</m> you'll do on your own:

        <li>
          <p>
            Complete the proof that <m>ax=b</m> has a unique solution by filling in the blanks:  Suppose that <m>ax = b</m>.
            First we must show that such an <m>x</m> exists.
            Since <m>a \in G</m> and <m>G</m> is a group,
            it follows that <m>a^{-1}</m> exists.
            Multiplying both sides of <m>ax = b</m> on the left by <m>a^{-1}</m>, we have
            <md>
              <mrow>a^{-1}(ax) \amp  = a^{-1}b \amp \mbox{(left multiplication by \(a^{-1}\))}</mrow>

            We have thus shown that <m>ax = b</m> implies <m>x  = a^{-1}b</m>,
            so <m>ax = b</m> can have at most one solution.
            We may also verify that <m>x  = a^{-1}b</m> is indeed a solution:
            <md>
              <mrow>a(a^{-1}b) \amp  =  (aa^{-1})b  \amp (\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)</mrow>

              <mrow>\amp  =b.  \amp (\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)</mrow>
            </md>
            This completes the proof that the solution both exists,
            and is unique.

  </exercise>
  <p>
    The key method used in these proofs,
    the composition of both sides of the equation by <m>a^{-1}</m>,
    is something you've seen many times before.
    For instance in high school algebra,
    to solve the equation <m>5x = 6</m> above,
    we teach our kids to divide each side by 5.
    Remember that dividing by 5 is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal <m>1/5</m>.
    And <m>1/5</m> is the multiplicative inverse of 5.
    So in fact we are composing (multiplying) each side of the equation by <m>5^{-1}</m> in order to solve for <m>x</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As in our example then,
    composing both sides of the equation by <m>a^{-1}</m> is not only useful for the proofs,
    but in actually solving for <m>x</m>.
    Therefore, no matter what crazy elements and strange binary operation make up our group,
    we can still solve for <m>x</m> using the same algebra we learned in high school.
    In other words, given a group <m>G</m> and <m>a,b \in G</m>,
    if <m>ax =b</m>, then <m>x = a^{-1}b</m>;
    if <m>xa =b</m>, then <m>x = ba^{-1}</m>; and so on.
    Use this methodology in the following exercises.

    In our work so far, we've frequently used the
    <term>substitution property</term>.
        <idx><h>Substitution property</h></idx>
    For instance if <m>x = y</m>,
    then we know also that <m>a\cdot x = a \cdot y</m>,
    regardless of the operation <m>\cdot</m>.
    But suppose I gave you the equation <m>a \cdot x = a \cdot y</m>.
    Is it necessarily true that <m>x = y</m>?
    If <m>a, x,y \in {\mathbb R}</m> and the operation is multiplication,
    then it's true <em>as long as <m>a \neq 0</m></em>.
    To show this,
    we may use the method we talked about in the previous proposition:
    multiply each side of the equation by <m>a^{-1}</m>
    (that is, divide by a),
    and the result is <m>x = y</m>.
    In basic algebra courses this property is often called the
    <term>law of cancellation</term>.
        <idx><h>Law of cancellation</h></idx>
    Now this works for real numbers:
    but suppose <m>a,x,y</m> were elements of some other group.
    Would the law of cancellation still hold?
    In fact, using the method shown above,
    you can prove this property holds for any group <m>G</m>.

      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We will prove part (1), and you will do the rest.
      We can break part (1) into four cases: (a)
      <m>m,n \ge 0</m>; (b) <m>m,n \lt 0</m>; (c)
      <m>m \ge 0, n\lt 0</m>; (d) <m>m\lt 0, n \ge 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider first case (a).
      Using <xref ref="definition_Groups_DefGroupExponents">Definition</xref>, we have
      <me>
        g^m g^n = \underbrace{g \cdot g \cdots g}_{m \; { times}}\underbrace{g \cdot g \cdots g}_{n \; { times}}
      </me>,
      and
      <me>
        g^{m+n} = \underbrace{g \cdot g \cdots g}_{m+n \; { times}}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the right-hand sides of these expressions are equal,
      then so are the left-hand sides:
      so <m>g^mg^n = g^{m+n}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof of case (b) is exactly the same,
      except on the right-hand sides we should replace all <m>g</m>'s with <m>g^{-1}</m> and we should also replace <sq><m>m</m> times</sq>,
      <sq><m>n</m> times</sq>,
      and <sq><m>m+n</m> times</sq> with <sq><m>-m</m> times</sq>,
      <sq><m>-n</m> times</sq>,
      and <sq><m>-(m+n)</m> times</sq> respectively (recall that <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are negative,
      so <m>-(m+n)</m> is positive).
      These replacements gives us <m>g^mg^n =( g^{-1})^{-(m+n)}</m>,
      and according to <xref ref="definition_Groups_DefGroupExponents">Definition</xref>
      we may rewrite this as <m>g^mg^n = g^{m+n}</m>.
      This completes the proof of case (b).
    </p>
    <p>
      In case (c), we have
      <me>
        g^m g^n = \underbrace{g \cdot g \cdots g}_{m \; { times}}\underbrace{g^{-1} \cdot g^{-1} \cdots g^{-1}}_{-n \; { times}}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now have two subcases to consider.
      First, if <m>m \ge -n</m>,
      then all of the <m>g^{-1}</m> factors cancel and we end up with
      <me>
        g^m g^n = \underbrace{g \cdot g \cdots g}_{m+n \; { times}}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, if <m>m \lt  -n</m>,
      then all of the <m>g</m> factors are canceled and we end up with
      <me>
        g^m g^n = \underbrace{g^{-1} \cdot g^{-1} \cdots g^{-1}}_{-(m+n) \; { times}}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In either of these subcases,
      the right-hand side agrees with the definition of <m>g^{m+n}</m>,
      so the equality is proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Case (d) is just like (c),
      except we exchange the signs on the <m>g</m>'s, <m>m</m>'s and <m>n</m>'s on the right-hand sides.
      This completes the proof of part (1).

    </exercise>
  </proof>
  <p>
    Notice that <m>(gh)^n \neq g^nh^n</m> in general,
    since the group may not be abelian.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the group is <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> or <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>,
    we write the group operation additively and the exponential operation multiplicatively;
    that is, we write <m>ng</m> instead of <m>g^n</m>.
    The laws of exponents now become
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>mg + ng = (m+n)g</m> for all <m>m, n \in {\mathbb Z}</m>;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>m(ng) = (mn)g</m> for all <m>m, n \in {\mathbb Z}</m>;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>m(g + h) = mg + mh</m> for all <m>m \in {\mathbb Z}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to realize that the last statement can be made only because
    <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> are abelian groups.

  <remark>
    <p>
      (<em>historical background</em>) Although the first clear axiomatic definition of a group was not given until the late 1800s,
      group-theoretic methods had been employed before this time in the development of many areas of mathematics,
      including geometry and the theory of algebraic equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph-Louis Lagrange
          <idx><h>Lagrange, Joseph-Louis</h></idx>
      used group-theoretic methods in a 1770<ndash/>1771 memoir to study methods of solving polynomial equations.
      Later, &#xc9;variste Galois
          <idx><h>Galois, &#xc9;variste</h></idx>
      (1811<ndash/>1832) succeeded in developing the mathematics necessary to determine exactly which polynomial equations could be solved in terms of the polynomials' coefficients.
      Galois' primary tool was group theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study of geometry was revolutionized in 1872 when Felix Klein
          <idx><h>Klein, Felix</h></idx>
      proposed that geometric spaces should be studied by examining those properties that are invariant under a transformation of the space.
      Sophus Lie,
          <idx><h>Lie, Sophus</h></idx>
      a contemporary of Klein,
      used group theory to study solutions of partial differential equations.
      One of the first modern treatments of group theory appeared in William Burnside's
          <idx><h>Burnside, William</h></idx>
      <em>The Theory of Groups of Finite Order</em>
      [1], first published in 1897.
