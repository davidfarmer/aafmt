    <p>
      We begin this section with an example.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose Inspector Gadget knows two facts:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Alice is the thief's wife, and
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Alice is Bob's wife.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            Then the inspector can arrest Bob for theft,
            because a person cannot (legally) be the wife of more than one husband.<fn>
            According to U.S. law as of 2017.
            </fn>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              On the other hand, suppose the inspector knows:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Alice is the forger's mother, and
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Alice is Charlie's mother.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            Then the inspector does not know enough to be sure who the forger is,
            because it could be some other child of Alice.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This example illustrates a fundamental difference between the
          <m>\var{wife}</m> function and the <m>\var{mother}</m> function:
          two different people can have the same mother,
          but only one person can have any particular person as their legal wife.
          In mathematical terms, this important property of the
          <m>\var{wife}</m> function is expressed by saying that the
          <m>\var{wife}</m> function is <em>one-to-one</em>.

        <p>
          Now let's revisit the function we saw in <xref ref="example_Functions_nonnumfuncs">Example</xref> part (1).
          <m>\var{Temp}</m> is the function from the set of points on the earth to the set of measured temperatures at those points.
          Is <m>\var{Temp}</m> a one-to-one function?
          Not at all: it's very likely that at any given time,
          at least two points on the equator have exactly the same temperature (to arbitrary precision).<fn>
          It's not only likely: it's a sure thing.
          This can be proven mathematically,
          given that <m>\var{Temp}</m> is a continuous function.
          Can you prove it?
          </fn>
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way to say this is that at any given time,
        </p>
        <p>
          there exists a temperature <m>b</m> for which we can find two points on earth <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>\var{Temp}(x) = \var{Temp}(y) = b</m>.

      <p>
        If you have an arrow diagram of a function,
        then it is easy to tell whether or not the function is one-to-one.
        For example:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The function<nbsp/><m>f</m> in <xref ref="arrow11">Figure</xref>(a) is
              <em>not</em> one-to-one.
              This is because the arrow from<nbsp/><m>\var{b}</m> and the arrow from<nbsp/><m>\var{c}</m> go to the same place,
              so <m>f(\var{b}) = f(\var{c})</m>.
              In general, if arrows from two different elements of the domain go to the same element of the range,
              then the function is not one-to-one.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The function<nbsp/><m>g</m> of <xref ref="arrow11">Figure</xref>(b) is one-to-one.
              This is because the arrows from two different elements of the domain never go to the same element of the range.
              In short, there is only <em>one</em>
              element of the domain that goes <em>to</em>
              any <em>one</em> element of the range.

      This concept of one-to-one is very useful.
      If we know <m>A</m> is a function,
      we know that every input of <m>A</m> has exactly one output.
      But if we know that <m>A</m> is a one-to-one function,
      then we also know that every output in the range of <m>A</m> is caused by
      <em>exactly</em> one input.
      Alternatively,
      we can say that every potential output in the codomain has
      <em>at most one</em> input.

    <title>Proving that a function is one-to-one</title>
    <p>
      The concept of one-to-one will be very important in this course,
      and one of the tools we will need is the ability to prove that a function is one-to-one.
      Though many of the functions we will encounter throughout this book are not algebraic,
      we will learn this style of proof using algebraic functions,
      as they are a bit easier to deal with.
      Here are some examples of this type of proof.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Functions_1_to_1_or_not">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Determine which of the following functions are one-to-one.
          If so, give a proof.
          If not, give a counterexample.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m>,
                defined by <m>f(x)=x +1</m>.
                Let's go back to the definition of one-to-one.
                Suppose we know that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>,
                where <m>x,y</m> are real numbers.
                Can we conclude that <m>x=y</m>?
                If so, then that means that <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
                So let's follow through on this.
                <m>f(x)=f(y)</m> means that <m>x+1=y+1</m>.
                Subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation,
                we find that indeed, <m>x=y</m>.
                Hence, <m>f</m> is one-to-one,
                according to the definition.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f\colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{R}</m> by <m>f(z) = \text{ Re } [z]</m>.
                Let's start the same way as the previous example.
                Suppose we know that <m>f(z) = f(w)</m>,
                where <m>w,z</m> are complex numbers.
                Can we conclude that <m>w=z</m>?
                In this case,
                <m>f(z) = f(w)</m> simply means that the real parts of <m>z</m> and <m>w</m> are equal.
                But there are many complex numbers in
                <m>\mathbb{C}</m> which have the same real part:
                for example, <m>2 + i</m> and <m>2 + 2i</m>.
                Since <m>f(2+i) = f(2+2i)</m>,
                it's not always true that <m>f(z) = f(w)</m> implies <m>z=w</m>.
                This single counterexample is enough to prove that <m>f</m> is not one-to-one.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f\colon \mathbb{A} \to \mathbb{R}</m>,
                where <m>f(z) = \text{ Re } [z]</m> and
                <m>A = \{z \in \mathbb{C}: \text{ Im } [z] = 4</m> \}. Notice that the function is the same as in the previous example,
                but the domain is different.
                This makes a big difference,
                and we don't get the same answer with this new domain.
                How can that be?
                Well, let's try to do the same as before,
                and see what goes haywire.
                Once again, suppose we know that
                <m>f(z) = f(w)</m>, where <m>w,z \in A</m>.
                As before, this means that <m>\text{ Re } [z]=\text{ Re } [w]</m>.
                But since <m>z,w \in A</m>,
                we also know that <m>\text{ Im } [z]=\text{ Im } [w]=4</m>.
                Since <m>z</m> and <m>w</m> have the same real and imaginary parts,
                they are equal.
                So <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>g\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m>,
                defined by <m>g(x)= |x|</m>.
                We demonstrate this by finding two distinct real numbers whose image is the same:
                <me>
                  g(1)=|1|=1=|-1|=g(-1)
                </me>,
                but <m>1\neq -1</m>.
                This shows that <m>g</m> is <em>not</em> one-to-one.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>h\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}</m>,
                defined by <m>h(x)=|x|</m>.
                Since all natural numbers are nonnegative,
                we have <m>|x|=x</m> for every natural number<nbsp/><m>x</m>.
                So given that <m>h(x)=h(y)</m>, we can argue as follows:
                <me>
                  h(x)=h(y) \implies |x| = |y| \implies x=y
                </me>.
                Hence <m>h</m> is one-to-one.
                (Note that the function <m>h</m> agrees with <m>g</m> in the previous example,
                but the result is different because the domains are different.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>h\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m>,
                defined by <m>h(x)= -x^2 + 7x  - 4</m>.
                If we try to apply the definition directly as above,
                we run into complications.
                So we try an indirect approach.
                We know how to solve <m>h(x)=y</m> using the quadratic formula:
                <me>
                  h(x)=y \implies -x^2 + 7x  - 4 = y  \implies x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{33 - 4y}}{2}
                </me>.
                The <m>\pm</m> is a tipoff that in some cases there may be two values of <m>x</m> that give the same <m>y</m>.
                We're free to choose <m>y</m>,
                so let's choose a value that gives a simple result.
                Take <m>y=8</m> for instance, which gives us:
                <me>
                  x = \frac{7 \pm 1}{2} \text{ or }  x=3,4
                </me>.
                We can verify that in fact <m>h(3) = 8</m> and <m>h(4)=8</m>.
                Since in this case two different <m>x</m>'s give the same <m>y</m>,
                it follows that <m>h</m> is not one-to-one.
                This example gives us a chance to point out a common mistake.
                Suppose we chose <m>y = 33/4</m> instead of <m>y=8</m>.
                Then we would get <m>x = 7/2</m> as the unique value <m>x</m> such that <m>f(x) = 33/4</m>.
                But this is <em>not</em> enough to prove that <m>h</m> is one-to-one.

        In previous classes you may have seen the
        <em>horizontal line test</em><idx><h>Horizontal line test</h><h>for one-to-one functions</h></idx>
            <idx><h>One-to-one</h><h>horizontal line test</h></idx>
        to show whether or not a function <m>f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</m> was one-to-one.
        We may show how this works using the function <m>f(x)=x +1</m>
        (which we already know is one-to-one from <xref ref="example_Functions_1_to_1_or_not">Example</xref> above).
        <xref ref="fig_xplus1">Figure</xref> is the graph of <m>f</m>,
        together with the graph of a horizontal line
        (dotted line).
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig_xplus1">
        <caption>Graph of function <m>f(x)=x +1</m> (with horizontal line used for horizontal line test).</caption>
        <image width="65%" source="images/xplus1.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Now, the the horizontal line has an equation of the form <m>y=c</m> (Why is this?).
        Any solution of the equation <m>f(x)=c</m> corresponds to a point of intersection between the graphs of <m>y=c</m> and <m>y=f(x)</m>.
        Now here's the key point.
        If for <em>every</em> horizontal line there's at most one intersection for
        <em>every</em> horizontal line,
        then for <em>every</em> real number <m>c</m>,
        the equation <m>f(x)=c</m> has at most one solution <ndash/>which is the same thing as saying that <m>f(x)</m> is one-to-one.
        We may state this result in general as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        (<em>Horizontal line test for one-to-oneness</em>)<nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/>The function
        <m>f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</m> is one-to-one if and only if the graph of <m>f(x)</m> intersects every horizontal line <em>at most once</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the horizontal line test proves that <m>f</m> is a one-to-one function, right?
        Alas, pictures are not proofs<ndash/>although they can be pretty convincing.
        Typically, a mathematician will use pictures to convince herself of what's true before attempting a real proof.
        (It's a lot easier to prove something when you're confident that it must be true.)
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, to disprove a function is one-to-one,
        you only need a single counterexample.
        Consider the function <m>g(x)= |x|</m> from Part 2 of <xref ref="example_Functions_1_to_1_or_not">Example</xref>,
        which is graphed in <xref ref="fig_absx">Figure</xref>.
        Using the graph we can easily identify two values in the domain that produce the same value in the codomain.
        However, while the horizontal line test here suggests our counterexample,
        we still need to verify that the counterexample works.
        So again we need the disproof in Part 2 of <xref ref="example_Functions_1_to_1_or_not">Example</xref>,
        not just a picture.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig_absx">

        <image width="65%" source="images/absx.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        In summary, the horizontal line test can only <em>suggest</em>
        whether or not a function is one-to-one.
        In the end, you still need to prove or disprove.
        Furthermore,
        the horizontal line test is usually only a good tool for functions whose domain and codomain are <m>{\mathbb R}</m>
        (or subsets of <m>{\mathbb R}</m>).

      When you don't know whether or not a particular function is one-to-one,
      a good strategy is to try to prove that it's one-to-one.
      If the proof works, then great you're done.
      If the proof fails,
      the manner in which it fails may indicate an example to show that the function is not one-to-one.
      Here's an example of this technique.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}</m> be defined by <m>f(n)=(n-2)^2 + 1</m>.
          Is <m>f</m> one-to-one?
        </p>
        <p>
          (Aside: Please take note of the domain in this problem.
          As we've noted previously,
          a function may be one-to-one on one domain,
          and not on a different domain.)
        </p>
        <p>
          First let's try to prove that <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
          Start with arbitrary elements
          <m>m,
          n \in \mathbb{N}</m>, and suppose that <m>f(m)=f(n)</m>.
          By the definition of <m>f</m>,
          this means that <m>(m-2)^2 + 1=(n-2)^2 + 1</m>,
          or <m>(m-2)^2 =(n-2)^2</m>.
          Two numbers have the same square,
          if and only if they are equal in absolute value,
          so it follows that <m>m-2 = \pm (n-2)</m>.
          There are now two cases:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>m-2=+(n-2)</m> then adding 2 to each side, we get <m>m=n</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>m-2 = -(n-2) = -n+2</m>,
                then adding 2 to each side, we get <m>m=-n+4</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>m,n \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
          it's not hard to see that if <m>n \ge 4</m>,
          then <m>-n+4</m> is not a natural number.
          But if <m>n</m> is 1,2,3 then <m>-n+4 \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
          For example <m>n=1</m> gives <m>m = 3</m>,
          which suggests that <m>f(1) = f(3)</m>.
          We may indeed check that <m>f(1) = f(3)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the great thing about cases where <m>f</m> is not one-to-one is that the writeup of the solution is very simple.
          All you have to do is give one example of two different values that return the same function value.
          In the current example we have:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Solution:</em> <m>f</m> is <em>not</em>
          one-to-one because <m>f(1) = 2</m> and <m>f(3) = 2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the writeup is easy: two values is all it takes.
          The hard thing is finding the two values!
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      There is an equivalent way to show functions are one-to-one that is also useful.
      To see it, recall the <m>\var{wife}</m> function from the beginning of the section.
      The <m>\var{wife}</m> function is one-to-one because one woman can't be (legally) married to two different husbands.
      We can express the same thing in a different way by saying that two different husbands must be married to two different wives.
      These two statements are <term>contrapositives</term>
          <idx><h>Contrapositive</h></idx>
      of each other, and are in fact equivalent. (
      <q>contrapositive</q>
      is a logical term<ndash/>you may have run across it before in other math classes.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If we generalize this reasoning to arbitrary one-to-one functions,
      we have the following two equivalent statements:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A function is one-to-one iff any element of the range is mapped from only one element of the domain;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A function is one-to-one iff two different elements of the domain always map to two different elements of the range.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We formalize this equivalence in the following alternative definition of one-to-one:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {121defn2}<term>(Alternate)</term>
          Suppose <m>f \colon A \to B</m>.
          We say <m>f</m> is a <term>one-to-one function</term><idx><h>One-to-one</h><h>alternate definition</h></idx> iff for all
          <m>a_1,a_2 \in A</m> such that <m>a_1 \neq a_2</m>,
          we have <m>f(a_1) \neq f(a_2)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We know from calculus that the function <m>e^x: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</m> is a
          <em>strictly increasing</em>
          function<idx><h>Function</h><h>strictly increasing</h></idx> since its derivative is always positive.
          In mathematical terms, we can say
          <me>
            x > y \text{ implies  }  e^x > e^y
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can use this fact and <xref ref="definition_Functions_121defn2">Definition</xref>
          to prove that <m>e^x</m> is a one-to-one function as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          Take any two real numbers <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> where <m>x_1 \neq x_2</m>.
          If <m>x_1 > x_2</m>,
          then by the above equation it follows that <m>e^{x_1} > e^{x_2}</m>.
          On the other hand, if <m>x_1 \lt x_2</m>,
          then by the above equation it follows that <m>e^{x_1} \lt e^{x_2}</m>.
          In either case, we have <m>e^{x_1} \neq e^{x_2}</m>.
          By <xref ref="definition_Functions_121defn2">Definition</xref>,
          it follows that <m>e^x</m> must be one-to-one.
