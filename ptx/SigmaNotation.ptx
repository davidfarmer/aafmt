  <title>Sigma Notation</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We're about to start looking at polynomials,
      which means we'll be working with sums of terms<ndash/>sometimes many terms.
      Such sums are often written using a special notation known as
      <q>sigma notation</q>. It's possible that you are already a master of sigma notation.
      If not, you can brush up with the material in this section.
      (At very least,
      you should try some of the exercises to make sure that you haven't gotten rusty.)
