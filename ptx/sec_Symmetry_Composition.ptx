  <title>Composition of symmetries</title>
  <p>
    Since the symmetries of a figure are functions,
    we can do anything with symmetries that we can do with functions<ndash/>including composition.
    That is, we can perform two symmetries on a figure back-to-back,
    and since they are both functions,
    by definition of function composition the result is a function.
    In fact, we saw in the Functions chapter that the composition of two bijections is a bijection.
    So the composition
    (or net motion)
    resulting from two symmetries is a bijection.
    But a bijection of a figure is not necessarily a symmetry. as we showed in <xref ref="exercise_Symmetry_bijectnotsym">Exercise</xref> above.
    This raises the question: is the composition of two symmetries a symmetry?
    That is: if one symmetry is followed by another on a figure,
    is the net motion a symmetry?
    You will investigate this question in the following exercise.

  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Symmetry_SymmComposition">
    <statement>
      <p>
        With reference to the symmetries of a rectangle in <xref ref="example_Symmetry_rectsymmetries">Example</xref>,
        let <m>r_{180}</m> be the <m>180^\circ</m> counterclockwise rotation and let <m>s_v</m> be the reflection across the vertical axis. (Note that reflection across the vertical axis is sometimes called
        <q>horizontal reflection,</q>
        since the figure
        <q>flips</q>
        from left to right.
        Admittedly this is confusing,
        but that's what people call it so what can you do?)
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <p>
              Write the function <m>r_{180}</m> in ordered pair notation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

            <p>
              Write the function <m>r_{180} \compose s_v</m> in ordered pair notation.
              Is it a symmetry of the rectangle?
              If so, then which one?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Write the function <m>s_v \compose r_{180}</m> in ordered pair notation.
              Is it a symmetry of the rectangle?
              If so, then which one?

        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    At this point let us introduce an alternative notation for symmetries that's easier to write.
    This notation is called <term>tableau form</term>,
    and for <m>r_{180}</m> it looks like the following:
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>r_{180} = \begin{pmatrix}A \amp B \amp C \amp D \\ C \amp D \amp A \amp B \end{pmatrix}</m>
  </p>
  <p>
    To form these,
    we simply put the inputs of our function on the top row and their corresponding outputs on the bottom row.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="example_Symmetry_sym_tableau">
    <statement>
      <p>
        For example, since
        <me>
          s_v = \{(A, D), (B,C), (C, B), (D, A) \}
        </me>,
        then the top row of the tableau for <m>s_v</m> would read,
        <q><m>A  B  C  D</m></q>, and the bottom row of the tableau would read,
        <q><m>D  C  B  A</m></q>. Hence
        <me>
          s_v = \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \amp  D \\ D \amp  C \amp  B \amp  A \end{pmatrix}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example xml:id="example_Symmetry_sym_comp_tableau">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose we wanted to find <m>r_{180} \compose s_v</m> using the tableau forms for <m>r_{180}</m> and <m>s_v</m> above.
        That is
        <me>
          r_{180} \compose s_v = \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \amp  D \\ C \amp  D \amp  A \amp  B \end{pmatrix}  \compose  \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \amp  D \\ D \amp  C \amp  B \amp  A \end{pmatrix}  = ?
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        To see how this works, let's
        <q>follow</q>
        each possible input (<m>A, B, C, D</m>) as we put it into the composition.
        Remember that the composition of functions works right to left;
        we are first reflecting the rectangle and then rotating it.
        So starting from the right,
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>s_v</m> takes <m>A \to D</m>,
              and <m>r_{180}</m> takes <m>D \to B</m>.
              Therefore <m>r_{180} \compose f_h</m> takes <m>A \to B</m>; i.e.
              <m>(r_{180} \compose s_v)(A) = B</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>s_v</m> takes <m>B \to C</m>,
              and <m>r_{180}</m> takes <m>C \to A</m>;
              therefore <m>r_{180} \compose s_v</m> takes <m>B \to A</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>s_v</m> takes <m>C \to B</m>,
              and <m>r_{180}</m> takes <m>B \to D</m>;
              therefore <m>r_{180} \compose s_v</m> takes <m>C \to D</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>s_v</m> takes <m>D \to A</m>,
              and <m>r_{180}</m> takes <m>A \to C</m>;
              therefore <m>r_{180} \compose s_v</m> takes <m>D \to C</m>

        In summary we have

          r_{180} \compose s_v = \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \amp  D \\ C \amp  D \amp  A \amp  B \end{pmatrix}  \compose  \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \amp  D \\ D \amp  C \amp  B \amp  A \end{pmatrix}  = \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \amp  D \\ B \amp  A \amp  D \amp  C \end{pmatrix}

    <xref ref="exercise_Symmetry_CompSymm">Exercises</xref>

    seem to indicate that the composition of two symmetries of a figure is a symmetry of the figure.
    We can actually prove that this is always true.
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="proposition_Symmetry_symcompclosed">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both symmetries of a figure.
        Then <m>f \compose g</m> is itself a symmetry of the same figure.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Recall that composition works from right to left.
      Since <m>g</m> is a symmetry,
      <m>g</m> takes the points of the figure and rearranges them so that the angles and distances of points in the figure are preserved.
      The symmetry<m>f</m> then takes the points of this preserved figure and moves them in such a way that the angles,
      and distances of points in the figure are preserved.
      Hence the net result of <m>f \compose g</m> preserves angles and distances between points in the figure.
      Therefore by definition, <m>f \compose g</m> is a symmetry of the figure.
