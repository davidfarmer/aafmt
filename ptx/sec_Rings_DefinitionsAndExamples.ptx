  <introduction>
    <p>
      Some of the number systems we've studied in previouos chapters are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>=integers
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>=rational numbers
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>{\mathbb R}</m>=real numbers
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>{\mathbb C}</m>=complex numbers
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>=integers mod n.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>{\mathbb Z}[x], {\mathbb Q}[x], {\mathbb R}[x], \ldots</m> = polynomials with coefficients in <m>{\mathbb Z, \mathbb Q, \mathbb R \ldots}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When studying rings
      (and groups),
      we put a lot of focus on the integers.
      The integers <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> have two operations:
      addition(+) and multiplication(<m>\cdot</m>).
      These operations have the following properties:
      <ol type="I">
        <li>
          <p>
            Closure: if <m>a, b \in {\mathbb Z}</m> then <m>a+b</m> and
            <m>a\cdot b</m> are in <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Associativity: if <m>a, b, c\in {\mathbb Z}</m> then
            <m>(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)</m> and <m>(a\cdot b)\cdot c=a\cdot (b\cdot c)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Zero: there is an element <m>0\in {\mathbb Z}</m> such that for all <m>a\in {\mathbb Z},~a+0=0+a=a</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            One: there is an element <m>1\in {\mathbb Z}</m> such that for all <m>a\in {\mathbb Z},~a\cdot 1=1\cdot a=a</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Commutativity of Addition:
            if <m>a,~b\in {\mathbb Z}</m>, then <m>a+b=b+a</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Additive Inverses: for every <m>a\in {\mathbb Z}</m>,
            there exists an element <m>-a\in {\mathbb Z}</m> such that <m>a+(-a)=0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Distributivity:
            for every <m>a,~b,~c\in {\mathbb Z}</m> we have that
            <m>a(b+c)=ab+ac</m> and <m>(b+c)a=ba+ca</m>.
            <em>Note</em> that commutativity of multiplication is
            <em>not</em> a property of all rings,
            so <m>a(b+c)=(b+c)a</m> is not necessarily true for a ring.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the number systems listed at the beginning of this chapter have properties I-VII. Similar properties are found in other number systems.<fn>
      The reader may recall that some of these same properties were listed in <xref ref="sec_Polynomials_PropertiesAndSigmaNotation">Section</xref>,
      when we were talking about coefficients of polynomials.
      </fn>
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {defring} Any number system with the two arithmetic operations (+ and <m>\cdot</m>) that satisfy properties I-VII is called a <term>ring</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      As well as having properties <m>I-VII</m>,
      multiplication is commutative in all of the above number systems.
      This leads us to the following definition:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {defcomring} A number system is a
          <term>commutative ring</term>
          if it is a ring where multiplication is also commutative.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The properties of a ring are so similar to those of a group that it warrants a short discussion.
      The main difference between a ring and a group is that a ring has two binary operations
      (usually called addition and multiplication)
      while a group has only one operation.
      In fact, if you consider just the operation of addition,
      then a ring is a group with respect to addition.
      As far as multiplication, a ring is
      <q>almost</q>
      a group with respect to multiplication except that not all elements have multiplicative inverses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we know what a ring is,
      how do we prove a number system forms a ring?
      If you said that we would have to prove that the number system fulfills properties <m>I-VII</m>,
      then you would be correct!
      Let's look at some examples that will show us how to prove a number system forms a ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rings we've talked about so far (<m>{\mathbb Z},{\mathbb Q},{\mathbb R},{\mathbb C}</m>) have all been infinite rings.
      But there are finite rings as well.
      In fact <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> is also a ring for any integer <m>n \ge 2</m>.
      We'll show this in the following example:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Rings_Zn_ring">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> is a ring for any integer <m>n \ge 2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Recall that <m>{\mathbb Z}_n=\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\}</m>.
          It is also important to note that the operations of addition and multiplication will be defined as <em>modular sum</em>
          and <em>modular product</em>,
          notated as <m>\oplus</m> and <m>\odot</m>, respectively.
          We should address each of the seven properties listed above to show that we have a ring.
          It turns out that we have already shown each of these properties in the chapter on modular arithmetic,
          <xref ref="ModularArithmetic">Chapter</xref>.
          Let's divide our proof into seven steps,
          one for each required ring property.
          <ol type="I">
            <li>
              <p>
                First we must show that <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> is closed under <m>\oplus</m> and <m>\odot</m>.
                In <xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmetic_closed_property_Zn">Proposition</xref>,
                we showed that the modular sum and modular product of two elements of
                <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> are also in <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.
                In other words,
                <m>a\oplus b \in{\mathbb Z}_n</m> and <m>a\odot b\in{\mathbb Z}_n</m>,
                for all <m>a,b\in{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.
                So <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> is closed under <m>\oplus</m> and <m>\odot</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Second, we must show that the associative property holds for <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.
                In <xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmetic_Zn_comm_assoc">Proposition</xref> (b),
                we show that <m>(a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c)</m> and <m>(a \odot b) \odot c = a \odot (b \odot c)</m>.
                So the associative property holds for <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Third, we will show that the zero property holds for <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.
                In <xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmetic_id_property_Zn">Proposition</xref>,
                we show that <m>0 \in {\mathbb Z}_n</m> and <m>a\oplus 0=0\oplus a=a</m>,
                for any <m>a\in{\mathbb Z}_n</m>,
                so <m>0</m> is the additive identity of
                <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> and the zero property holds.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Our next step is to show that
                <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> has the multiplicative identity property
                (one).
                Again, we will refer to <xref ref="subsec_ModularArithmetic_ArithWithRems">Section</xref>.
                In particular,
                <xref ref="exercise_ModularArithmetic_56">Exercise</xref>
                showed us that <m>1\in{\mathbb Z}_n</m> and <m>1\odot a=a\odot 1=a</m>,
                for any <m>a\in{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.
                So, the identity property of multiplication holds for <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The commutative property of <m>\oplus</m> for <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> must be proven next.
                <xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmetic_Zn_comm_assoc">Proposition</xref>
                (a) shows us that <m>a \oplus b = b \oplus a</m> and <m>a \odot b = b \odot a</m>,
                for all <m>a,b\in{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.
                Note that for a set to be a ring,
                we only need to show that commutativity of
                <em>addition</em> holds.
                Because commutativity of <em>multiplication</em>
                also holds for <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>,
                we may also have a <em>commutative</em> ring.
                Let's continue with our proof that
                <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> is a ring before we jump to that conclusion.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The sixth property that we must show is that of the additive inverse.
                We will refer back to <xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmetic_addinv_property_Zn">Proposition</xref>.
                Here we let <m>a' = n-a</m>, for any <m>a\in{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.
                We show that <m>a'\in{\mathbb Z}_n</m> and <m>a \oplus a' = a' \oplus a = 0 \pmod{ n}</m>:
                that is, <m>a'</m> is the additive inverse of <m>a</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                For our last step,
                we will show that the distributive property holds true for <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>.
                Once again, we have already shown that this is true.
                In <xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmetic_Zn_comm_assoc">Proposition</xref> (c),
                we show that <m>a \odot (b \oplus c) = (a \odot b)\oplus (a \odot c)</m>.
                Since <m>\odot</m> commutes in <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>,
                it follows that <m>a \odot (b \oplus c) = (b \oplus c) \odot a= (a \odot b)\oplus (a \odot c)</m> and the distributive property holds.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          We have shown that all seven ring properties hold true in
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> over <m>\oplus</m> and <m>\odot</m>.
          Additionally, we have shown that
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> commutes over <m>\odot</m>.
          So, <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> is a <em>commutative</em>
          ring and our proof is complete.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </example>
    <p>
      We've already mentioned that <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is a ring.
      Sometimes we can use rings to create larger rings by adding additional elements.
      Such rings are called <term>extension rings</term>.
      We will discuss these further in <xref ref="sec_Rings_ExtensionRings">Section</xref>.
      For now, let's look at a particular example.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Rings_extension_ring">
      <p>
        Prove that <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]=\{a_0+a_1\sqrt[3]{2}+a_2(\sqrt[3]{4})~|~a_0,a_1,a_2\in {\mathbb Q}\}</m> forms a ring.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note</em>:
        <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> is the set of all polynomials of the form:
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>a_0(\sqrt[3]{2})^0+a_1(\sqrt[3]{2})^1+a_2(\sqrt[3]{2})^2+\cdots+a_n(\sqrt[3]{2})^n</m>,
        where <m>a_0,a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n\in~{\mathbb Q}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, we have defined
        <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> using only the first three terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        (We will explain why three terms is enough later on in the proof.)
      </p>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To prove that <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> forms a ring,
          we must show <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> has all seven ring properties listed above.
          It will be useful to define a couple of arbitrary elements in our set:
          let <m>a,b\in{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> such that:
          <m>a=a_0+a_1\sqrt[3]{2}+a_2\sqrt[3]{4}</m> and <m>b=b_0+b_1\sqrt[3]{2}+b_2\sqrt[3]{4}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Property (1): First, we need to prove that
          <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> is closed under addition and multiplication.
          We will divide this task into two parts:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>a,b\in{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> then <m>a+b\in {\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m>.
                This is called <em>additive closure</em>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>a,b\in{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> then <m>ab\in {\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m>.
                This is called <em>multiplicative closure</em>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we will look at additive closure (a).
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that we have already defined two arbitrary elements in
          <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m>, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
          So,
          <md>
            <mrow>a+b\amp =(a_0+a_1\sqrt[3]{2}+a_2\sqrt[3]{4})+(b_0+b_1\sqrt[3]{2}+b_2\sqrt[3]{4})</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =(a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)\sqrt[3]{2}+(a_2+b_2)\sqrt[3]{4}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let <m>c_0=(a_0+b_0)</m>,
          <m>c_1=(a_1+b_1)</m> and <m>c_2=(a_2+b_2)</m>.
          Since <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is closed under addition,
          then <m>c_0,c_1,c_2\in{\mathbb Q}</m> and <m>a+b=c_0+c_1\sqrt[3]{2}+c_2\sqrt[3]{4}</m>.
          It should now be clear that this sum is indeed an element of <m>\in{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m>.
          We have shown that adding any two elements in
          <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> will always produce another element of <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m>.
          So, <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> is closed under addition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let's prove multiplicative closure <m>(b)</m>.
          We will again use <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> as defined earlier, so that:
          <md>
            <mrow>ab\amp =(a_0+a_1\sqrt[3]{2}+a_2\sqrt[3]{4})(b_0+b_1\sqrt[3]{2}+b_2\sqrt[3]{4})</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =(a_0b_0+2a_1b_2+2a_2b_1)+(a_0b_1+a_1b_0+2a_2b_2)\sqrt[3]{2}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  +(a_0b_2+a_1b_1+a_2b_0)\sqrt[3]{4}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we must show that this product is also an element of <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m>.
          Let's use a strategy similar to the one we used for additive closure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose we let <m>d_0,d_1,d_2\in{\mathbb Q}</m> such that <m>d_0=(a_0b_0+2a_1b_2+2a_2b_1)</m>,
          <m>d_1=(a_0b_1+a_1b_0+2a_2b_2)</m>,
          and <m>d_2=(a_0b_2+a_1b_1+a_2b_0)</m>.
          Since <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> is closed under multiplication,
          then <m>d_0,d_1,d_2\in{\mathbb Q}</m> and <m>ab=d_0+d_1\sqrt[3]{2}+d_2\sqrt[3]{4}\in{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m>.
          We have shown that multiplying any two elements in

          Let's continue with our proof of <xref ref="example_Rings_extension_ring">Example</xref>.
          We have shown that <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> satisfies the first property of rings.
          Now, let's take a look at property (2).
          We must show associativity for addition and multiplication.
          In other words, we must show that:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>a,b,c\in{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> then <m>(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)</m>, and
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>a,b,c\in{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> then <m>(ab)c=a(bc)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          For associativity of addition,
          let <m>a,b,c,\in{\mathbb Q}[ \sqrt[3]{2}]</m>.
          Since all of the numbers in <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> are real numbers,
          and the real numbers are associative,
          then it follows automatically that numbers in <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> also associate.
          We can make a similar argument for associativity of multiplication.
          Associativity is an example of an
          <em>inherited property</em>.

        <p>
          Property (3): This is known as the <em>zero property</em>.
          To prove this property,
          we must show that <m>0\in{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> and also that
          <m>a+0=0+a=0</m> for all <m>a\in{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m>.
          Notice that <m>0=0+0\sqrt[3]{2}+0\sqrt[3]{4}\in{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m>.
          Since all numbers,
          <m>a\in{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> are real numbers,
          it follows that <m>a+0=0+a=0</m>.
          So <m>0</m> is the zero element of
          <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> and property (3) holds true.

          we can show that <m>(B+(-C))\cdot(A\cdot(B+C))=A\cdot(B\cdot B+(-C)\cdot C))</m>.
          Give the reasons for the following steps in the simplification:
          <md>
            <mrow>(B+(-C))\cdot(A\cdot(B+C))\amp =(A\cdot(B+C))\cdot(B+(-C)) \amp  \text{ Comm. prop. }</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =A\cdot((B+C)\cdot(B+(-C))) \amp  \text{ Assoc. prop. }</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =A\cdot(((B+C)\cdot B)+((B+C)\cdot(-C))) \amp  \underline{\lt ~1~>}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =A\cdot((B\cdot B+C\cdot B)+(B\cdot (-C)+C\cdot (-C))) \amp  \underline{\lt ~2~>}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =A\cdot((B\cdot B+B\cdot C)+((-C)\cdot(B)+(-C)\cdot C))  \amp  \underline{\lt ~3~>}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =A\cdot(B\cdot B+(B\cdot C+(-C)\cdot(B)+(-C)\cdot C))  \amp  \underline{\lt ~4~>}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =A\cdot(B\cdot B+(B\cdot C+B\cdot(-C))+(-C)\cdot C)) \amp  \underline{\lt ~5~>}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =A\cdot(B\cdot B+(B\cdot(C+(-C))+(-C)\cdot C)) \amp  \underline{\lt ~6~>}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =A\cdot(B\cdot B+(B\cdot(0)+(-C)\cdot C)) \amp  \underline{\lt ~7~>}</mrow>
