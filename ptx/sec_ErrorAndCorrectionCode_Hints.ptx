    <xref ref="exercise_ErrorAndCorrectionCode_hamming">Exercise</xref>(c): Apply part (b) to both sides of the equation,
    and show they are equal.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_ErrorAndCorrectionCode_ctns0">Exercise</xref>(a): Add any codeword to itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_ErrorAndCorrectionCode_code_dsn">Exercise</xref>(c): Use the paragraph just above this exercise.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_ErrorAndCorrectionCode_lincode0">Exercise</xref>: Show that the codewords in <m>C</m> that have <m>i</m>'th coordinate equal to 0 form a subgroup of <m>C</m>,
    and consider the cosets of this subgroup in <m>C</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_ErrorAndCorrectionCode_linlin">Exercise</xref>: What row should you add to the parity check matrix?
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_ErrorAndCorrectionCode_lineven">Exercise</xref>: Use the previous exercise to show the codewords of even weight in <m>C</m> form a subgroup.
    Then consider the cosets of this subgroup in <m>C</m>.
