    <title>Examples of isomorphisms</title>
    <p>
      Now that we have a formal definition of what it means for two groups to be isomorphic,
      let's look at some more examples,
      in order to get a good feel for identifying groups that are isomorphic and those that aren't.
    </p>
    <p>
      From high school and college algebra we are well familiar with the fact that when you multiply exponentials
      (with the same bases),
      the result of this operation is the same as if you had just kept the base and added the exponents.
      This equivalence of operations is a telltale sign for identifying possible isomorphic groups.
      The next two examples illustrate this observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our first example,
      we denote the set of integer powers of 2 as <m>2^{\mathbb Z}</m>, that is:
      <me>
        2^{\mathbb Z} \equiv \{\ldots, 2^{-2}, 2^{-1}, 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \ldots\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>2^{\mathbb Z}</m> with the operation of multiplication is a subgroup of <m>{\mathbb Q}^{\ast}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <example xml:id="example_Isomorphism_rational_isomorph">
      <statement>
        <p>
          When elements of <m>2^{\mathbb Z}</m> are multiplied together,
          their exponents add:
          we know this from basic algebra.
          This suggests there should be an isomorphism between
          <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> and <m>2^{\mathbb Z}</m>.
          In fact, we may define the function
          <m>\phi: {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow 2^{\mathbb Z}</m> by <m>\phi( n ) = 2^n</m>.
          To show that this is indeed an isomorphism,
          by our definition we must show two things: (a) that the function preserves the operations of the respective groups;
          and (b) that the function is a bijection:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <p>
                We may compute
                <me>
                  \phi( m + n ) = 2^{m + n} = 2^m 2^n = \phi( m ) \phi( n )
                </me>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                By definition the function <m>\phi</m> is onto the subset
                <m>\{2^n :n \in {\mathbb Z} \}</m> of <m>{\mathbb Q}^\ast</m>.
                To show that the map is injective,
                assume that <m>m \neq n</m>.
                If we can show that <m>\phi(m) \neq \phi(n)</m>, then we are done.
                Suppose that <m>m>n</m> and assume that <m>\phi(m) = \phi(n)</m>.
                Then <m>2^m = 2^n</m> or <m>2^{m-n} = 1</m>,
                which is impossible since <m>m-n>0</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          This completes the proof that <m>{\mathbb Z} \cong 2^{\mathbb Z}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example_Isomorphism_RealIsomorph">
      <statement>
        <p>
          As in the previous example,
          the real powers of <m>e</m> under multiplication acts exactly like addition of those real exponents.
          This suggests that the function
          <m>\psi(x)=e^x</m> is an isomorphism between an additive group and a multiplicative group.
          The reader will complete this proof of this fact as an exercise.

                where <m>\cdot</m> and <m>\compose</m> are the group operations on the domain and range,respectively.
                Verify that <m>\psi</m> does indeed preserve operations for these two operations.

          Consider the groups <m>{\mathbb Z}_8</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>.
          Can you tell right away that there can't be an isomorphism between them?
          Remember, an isomorphism is a one-to-one and onto function:
          but since <m>|{\mathbb Z}_{12}|>|{\mathbb Z}_{8}|</m> there is no onto function from
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_8</m> to <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m>,
          and so they can't be isomorphic to each other.
          Similarly it can be shown that any two finite groups that have differing numbers of elements can't be isomorphic to each other.

          Notice that the main diagonals

          The main diagonal for <m>{\mathbb Z}_4</m> is the alternating sequence,
          <m>0, 2, 0, 2</m>,
          while the main diagonal of <m>U(5)</m> is the non-alternating sequence <m>1, 4, 4, 1</m>.
          It appears at first sight that these two groups must be non-isomorphic.
          However, we may rearrange the row and column labels in <xref ref="U5_table">Table</xref>
          to obtain <xref ref="U5_table2">Table</xref>.
          From the rearranged table we may read off the isomorphism:

          You may verify that <m>N</m> is in fact the group of all even permutations on three elements,

          and <m>(12) N = \{ (12), (13), (23) \}</m> is the set of odd permutations.
          The information captured in <m>S_3/N</m> is parity;
          that is, multiplying two even or two odd permutations results in an even permutation,
          whereas multiplying an odd permutation by an even permutation yields an odd permutation.

      We've seen several examples where Cayley tables were used to show that two groups are isomorphic. (Of course,
      this works best if the groups are not too large,
      and it certainly doesn't work if the groups are infinite!) Let's now consider how we can use Cayley tables to show when groups are <em>not</em>
      isomorphic to each other.
      Caution: it's not enough to have Cayley tables for the two groups that don't match<mdash/>we saw in <xref ref="example_Isomorphism_Cayley_noniso">Example</xref>
      that even when tables don't match,
      it may still be possible to rearrange one of the tables to create a matchup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that if <m>T</m> is a Cayley table of a group <m>G</m>.
      Then <m>g \in G</m> appears on the diagonal of <m>T</m> if and only if there is an element
      <m>g' \in G</m> such that <m>g' \cdot g' = g</m>.
      It turns out that this property is preserved under isomorphism:

          Let <m>\phi:G \rightarrow H</m> be an isomorphism,

        <p>
          Note that the Cayley table for
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> is symmetric across the main diagonal while the Cayley table for <m>D_3</m> is not.
          Furthermore,
          no matter how we rearrange the row and column headings for the Cayley table for <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m>,
          the table will always be symmetric.
          It follows that there is no way to to match up the two groups' Cayley tables:
          so <m>D_3 \ncong {\mathbb Z}_6</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This argument via Cayley table works in the case where the two groups being compared are both small,
          but if the groups are large then it's far too time-consuming
          (especially if the groups are infinite!).
          So let us take a different approach,
          and fall back on our time-tested strategy of proof by contradiction.
          In the case at hand,
          this means that we first suppose that <m>D_3 \cong {\mathbb Z}_6</m>,
          and then find a contradiction based on that supposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, suppose that the two groups are isomorphic,
          which means there exists an isomorphism <m>\phi : {\mathbb Z}_6 \rightarrow  D_3</m>.
          Let <m>a , b \in D_3</m> be two elements such that <m>a\circ b \neq b \circ a</m>.
          Since <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism,
          there exist elements <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> such<nbsp/>that
          <me>
            \phi( m )  = a  \text{ and } \phi( n )  = b
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However,
          <me>
            a\circ b = \phi(m ) \circ  \phi(n) = \phi(m \oplus  n) = \phi(n \oplus m) = \phi(n ) \circ \phi(m) = b \circ a
          </me>,
          which contradicts the fact that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> do not commute.

      Finally, let's look at <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> and <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.
      We know <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is a cyclic group with <m>1</m> as the generator,
      while <m>{\mathbb R}</m> is not cyclic. (Do you remember why?) We might suspect that <m>{\mathbb Z} \ncong {\mathbb R}</m>,
      since one group is cyclic and the other isn't.
      This is in fact true, and we'll prove it.
      Since <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> and
      <m>{\mathbb R}</m> are infinite groups we can't use Cayley tables,
      so we have to use another method (three guesses as to what it is):
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Isomorphism_not_isomorph_cyclic">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is not isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will use a proof by contradiction.
        Suppose that there exists an isomorphism <m>\phi: {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}</m>.
        Choose any <m>x \in {\mathbb R}</m>,
        and let <m>m \in {\mathbb Z}</m> be the pre-image of <m>x</m>,
        so that <m>\phi(m) = x</m>.
        It follows that:
        <md>
          <mrow>x \amp = \phi(m) = \phi(\underbrace{1 + \ldots + 1}_{m~\textrm{times} })= \underbrace{\phi(1) + \ldots + \phi(1)}_{m~\textrm{times} }</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus <m>x \in \langle \phi(1) \rangle</m>.
        But since this is true for <em>any</em>
        <m>x \in {\mathbb R}</m>,
        this means that <m>\phi(1)</m> is a generator of <m>{\mathbb R}</m>,
        which means that <m>{\mathbb R}</m> is cyclic.
        But we've already seen that
        <m>{\mathbb R}</m> is <em>not</em> cyclic.
        This contradiction shows that our original supposition must be false:
        namely, there <em>cannot</em> exist an isomorphism <m>\phi: {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}</m>.
        This completes the proof.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Again we can generalize this proof to prove that a cyclic group cannot be isomorphic to a non-cyclic group.
      The contrapositive of this statement is:

      In the foregoing examples,

              <mrow>\amp = \phi(g_1) \phi(g_2^{-1}) \amp (\text{ by Proposition~ } \underline{~\lt 4>~})</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \phi(g_1 g_2^{-1}) \amp (\text{ by the definition of } \underline{~\lt 5>~})</mrow>

          <p>
            Since <m>g_1 g_2^{-1}</m> is an element of <m>G'</m>,
            it follows that <m>h_1 h_2^{-1} \in \underline{~\lt 6>~}</m>.
            This completes the proof of Step (I).

            Complete the following proof of Step (II) (that is,
            <m>G'</m> and <m>\phi(G')</m> are isomorphic).
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the function <m>\phi</m> restricted to the set <m>G'</m>:
            that is, <m>\phi: G' \rightarrow \phi(G')</m>.
            To prove this gives an isomorphism from <m>G'</m> to <m>\phi(G')</m>,
            we need to show (i) <m>\phi: G' \rightarrow \phi(G')</m> is a bijection;
            and (ii) <m>\phi: G' \rightarrow \phi(G')</m> has the operation-preserving property.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show (i), we note that by the definition of <m>\phi(G')</m>,
            for every <m>h \in \phi(G')</m> there exists a
            <m>g \in \underline{~\lt 1>~}</m> such that <m>\phi(\underline{~\lt 2>~}) = h</m>.
            It follows that <m>\phi</m> maps <m>G'</m> onto <m>\underline{~\lt 3>~}</m>.
            Also, if <m>g_1, g_2 \in G'</m> and <m>\phi(g_1) = \phi(g_2)</m>,
            then since <m>\phi</m> is a one-to-one function on <m>G</m> it follows that <m>g_1 = \underline{~\lt 4>~}</m>.
            From this it follows that <m>\phi</m> is also a one-to-one function on <m>\underline{~\lt 5>~}</m>.
            We conclude that <m>\underline{~\lt 6>~}</m> is a bijection.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show (ii),
            given <m>g_1, g_2 \in \underline{~\lt 7>~}</m> we have that
            <m>\phi(g_1 g_2) = \underline{~\lt 8>~}</m> since by assumption <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism from
            <em><m>~\lt 9>~</m></em>
            to <em><m>~\lt 10>~</m></em>.
            This implies that <m>\phi</m> also has the operation-preserving property when it's considered as a function from
            <em><m>~\lt 11>~</m></em> to
            <em><m>~\lt 12>~</m></em>.
            This completes the proof of Step (II).
