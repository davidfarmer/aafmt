  <title>Group Actions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We've defined a
      <q>group</q>
      as as set with an operation defined on it.
      From this point of view, group elements are
      <q>objects</q>
      in a set.
      We have many examples of this:
      like the integers with addition,
      the integers mod <m>n</m>,
      the group of units <m>U(n)</m>,
      groups of matrices, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on we introduced the idea that permutations form a group.
      Permutations are actually bijections (1-1, onto functions) that map a set of objects to itself.
      Another way of saying this is that permutations
      <q>act on</q>
      a set by moving the elements around.
      Similarly, we saw in <xref ref="fig_groups_s3_symmetry">Figure</xref>
      in <xref ref="sec_Symmetry_Group">Section</xref>
      that the symmetries of an equilateral triangle
      (which are elements of the group <m>S_3</m>)
      move the vertices of the triangle from one position to another.
      As a third example, in the group
      <m>\mathbb {Q}^*</m> of non-zero rational numbers we can think of left multiplying by <m>2</m> as
      <q>moving</q>
      <m>-5</m> over to <m>-10</m>.
      Left multiplying again by <m>2</m>
      <q>moves</q>
      <m>-10</m> to <m>-20</m>: and so on.
    </p>

      The examples in the previous paragraph illustrate a general concept called <em>group actions</em>.

      We will see in this chapter how group actions can give us deeper insight into the symmetries that we see in the world around us.
      In particular,
      we will focus on what group actions can tell us about regular polyhedra such as the tetrahedron and cube.
