  <title>An unexplained miracle</title>
  <p>
    It's good for us to step back for a moment and take stock of what we've accomplished so far.
    We'll begin with some exercises.
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Symmetry_46">
    <statement>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p>
            Give the Cayley table for the integers mod 4 under addition.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Give the Cayley table for the four rotations of the square (4-sided polygon).
            You may use <m>r</m> to denote rotation by <m>90</m> degrees,
            so that the rotations will be <m>\{ {\var id}, r, r^2, r^3 \}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Give the Cayley table for the four complex <m>4'{th}</m> roots of unity.
            You may use <m>z</m> to denote cis(<m>\pi / 2</m>) so that the roots will be <m>\{ 1, z, z^2, z^3 \}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do you see any connection between your answers to (a), (b),
            and (c) above?

    show a deep connection between three extremely diverse concepts that arose from three totally different fields of study:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Arithmetic mod <m>n</m>,
          which first arose from the study of the natural numbers and their divisibility properties;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <m>n</m>'th complex roots of unity,
          a concept that arose from the study of roots of polynomials.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The rotations of a regular <m>n</m>-gon,
          which is a purely geometrical phenomenon.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    We express the amazing similarity between these three diverse concepts by saying that they are all described by the
    <q>same</q>
    group.
    (The technical term for this is
    <q>isomorphism</q>: we will study this concept in detail in <xref ref="Isomorphism">Chapter</xref>.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Take a moment to appreciate how incredible this is.
    How is it that three concepts with totally different backgrounds and completely different applications end up being described in exactly the same way?
  </p>
  <p>
    But the wonders do not stop there.
    It turns out that an infinite version of this same group is an important part of the so-called Standard Model of quantum physics,
    that is used to explain the existence of particles such as electrons, protons,
    and neutrons.
    How is it that a mathematical structure introduced by an <m>18^{th}</m> century mathematician<fn>
    This mathematician was Leonhard Euler (1707-1783).
    The integers mod <m>n</m> were further developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855).
    </fn> to study integer division could end up influencing the theory of elementary particles that were not even dreamed of in the <m>18^{th}</m> century?
  </p>
  <p>
    This mystical unity of description across widely different phenomena says something very profound about the universe.
    Galileo<fn>
    Galileo Galilei, Italian physicist (1564-1642),
    whose work on the motion of objects was foundational to the later work of Isaac Newton.
    </fn> expressed it this way: "Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe." When Galileo said this,
    his mathematics consisted of little more than what today we would call
    <q>high school algebra</q>
    <mdash/> he had not an inkling of abstract algebra.
    But what Galileo expressed based on his limited mathematics has turned been fulfilled with a vengeance by abstract algebra.
  </p>
  <p>
    Physicist Eugene Paul Wigner<fn>
    1902-1995
    </fn> won the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physics,
    in part because of his application of the theory of groups to quantum physics.
    In 1960 Wigner wrote a famous paper called "the Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences,"<fn>
    The paper can be found at:
    http://www.dartmouth.edu/<m>\sim</m>matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html
    </fn> in which he states: "The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve." To this day,
    apparently no physicist or mathematician has yet offered a satisfactory explanation for Wigner's
    <q>miracle</q>.
