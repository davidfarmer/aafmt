  <title>Complex Numbers</title>

      <em>Horatio</em> O day and night,
      but this is wondrous strange!
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Hamlet</em> And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
      There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    </p>

      Although complex numbers are defined to include
      <q>imaginary</q>
      numbers, the practical applications of complex numbers are far from
      <q>imaginary</q>. We shall touch on some of the applications in this chapter:
      but there are many many more in engineering,
      in physics, and in other sciences as well.
