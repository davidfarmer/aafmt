    With reference to the set of symmetries of a particular figure,
    <xref ref="proposition_Symmetry_symcompclosed">Proposition</xref>
    tells us that this set is closed under the operation of composition.
    Given this fact,
    the next natural inquiry is to see if this set of symmetries forms a group under composition.
    Let's look first at a particular example to see if it works.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="example_Symmetry_symmsofeqtri">
    <statement>
      <p>
        <xref ref="fig_groups_s3_symmetry">Figure</xref>
        shows all the symmetries of an equilateral triangle:
        <m>{\var id}</m> is the identity ; <m>\rho_1</m> is the
        <m>120^\circ</m> counterclockwise rotation;
        <m>\rho_2</m> is the <m>240^\circ</m> counterclockwise rotation;
        <m>\mu_1</m> is the reflection across the median through <m>A</m>;
        <m>\mu_2</m> is the reflection across the median through <m>B</m>;
        and <m>\mu_3</m> is the reflection across the median through <m>C</m>.
        We remind the reader once again of the comment we made in <xref ref="example_Symmetry_hexagon">Example</xref>:
        for example,
        in the symmetry <m>\rho_1</m> the triangle's vertices <m>A,B,C</m> before the motion appear to be relabeled as <m>C,A,B</m> respectively,
        which means that <m>C \rightarrow A</m>,
        <m>A \rightarrow B</m>, and
        <m>B \rightarrow C</m> rather than vice-versa.

    So far so good.
    The composition operation on <m>S</m> has closure,
    an identity, and inverses for each element.
    There is one more group property left to check <mdash/> the associative property.
    It is difficult to check this property on the Cayley table of <m>S</m>;
    we would have to prove it for all 3-symmetry combinations in <m>S</m>,
    which would be a bit exhausting.<fn>
    In mathematics, there is a type of proof called
    <q>proof by exhaustion,</q>
    but this is typically a last resort.
    One famous mathematician (George Polya) once said, "Mathematics is being lazy.
    Mathematics is letting the principles do the work for you so that you do not have to do the work for yourself."
    </fn> However,
    luckily we can prove the symmetries of any figure are associative in general.
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="proposition_Symmetry_symcompassoc">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The set of symmetries <m>S</m> of any figure under composition is associative.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      By definition, we know any symmetry of a figure is a function.
      From the Functions chapter,
      we know that composition of functions is associative.
      Therefore for any three symmetries <m>s_1, s_2, s_3 \in S</m>,
      by the associative property of functions,
      <me>
        \bigl( s_1 \compose s_2 \bigr) \compose s_3 = s_1 \compose \bigl( s_2 \compose s_3 \bigr)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore <m>S</m> is associative under composition.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    Tada!
    The set of symmetries of an equilateral triangle are indeed a group under function composition.
  </p>
  <p>
    We've managed to prove this for one example;
    what about for the set of symmetries of any figure?
    Could we prove the set of symmetries of any figure are a group under composition?
    We've already proved the closure and associative properties hold for any figure
    (<xref ref="proposition_Symmetry_symcompassoc">Propositons</xref>
    and <xref ref="proposition_Symmetry_symcompclosed"></xref>).
    Now what about the identity and existence of inverses?
    We could create Cayley tables for the infinite number of figures,
    but we have better things to do.
    So let's prove these properties generally.
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="proposition_Symmetry_symcompid">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The set of symmetries <m>S</m> of any figure has an identity.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      By the definition of a symmetry,
      the "non-movement" of a figure is a symmetry:
      it corresponds to the identity function <m>{\var id}</m>.
      Then for any symmetry <m>s \in S</m>,
      using results from the Functions chapter we have
      <me>
        {\var id} \compose s = s \compose {\var id} = s
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So by the definition of identity,
      <m>{\var id}</m> is the identity of <m>S</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <proposition xml:id="proposition_Symmetry_symcompinv">
    <statement>
      <p>
        All elements of the set <m>S</m> of symmetries of any figure have inverses.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Given a symmetry <m>s \in S</m>,
      by definition <m>s</m> is a bijection.
      In the Functions chapter,
      we showed that every bijection has an inverse <m>s^{-1}</m>.
      It remains to show that <m>s^{-1}</m> is itself a symmetry.
      This means that we have to show:
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>s^{-1}</m> leaves distances unchanged between points in the figure;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>s^{-1}</m> leaves angles unchanged between points in the figure;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>s^{-1}</m> leaves the appearance of the figure unchanged.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      These three items are proved as follows:
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          <p>
            This proof is similar to (ii),
            and we leave it as an exercise.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We show that <m>s^{-1}</m> leaves angles and distances between points unchanged as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Choose any three points <m>A, B, C</m> in the figure,
                  and let <m>A'=s^{-1}(A), B'=s^{-1}(B), C'=s^{-1}(C)</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  By the definition of inverse,
                  it follows that <m>s(A')=A, s(B')=B, s(C')=C</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Since <m>s</m> is a symmetry,
                  it follows that <m>\angle A'B'C' =\angle ABC</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Since <m>A,B, C</m> were arbitrary points in the figure,
                  we have shown that <m>s^{-1}</m> leaves angles between points unchanged.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In the Functions chapter, we showed that <m>s^{-1}</m> is also a bijection.
            Hence it leaves the appearance of the figure unchanged.

            describes one symmetry:
            give similar descriptions of all symmetries of the square.
            For rotations,
            use counterclockwise rotations rather than clockwise:
            it's the mathy way of doing rotations.)
