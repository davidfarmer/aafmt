  <title>Formal definition of a group</title>
  <p>
    Historically,
    the theory of groups first arose from attempts to find the roots of polynomials in terms of their coefficients.
    But groups have moved far beyond their original application,
    and now play a central role in such areas as coding theory,
    counting, and the study of symmetries.
    Many areas of biology, chemistry,
    and physics have benefited from group theory.
    In the preceding chapters we've already worked with a number of different groups,
    including the integers mod <m>n</m> and the symmetries of a rectangle or regular polygon.
    Recall that a group basically consists of a set and a
    <q>compatible</q>
    operation:
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p>
            What operation is the set <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> a group under?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What operation is the set <m>S_3</m> a group under?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    The following definition formalizes the notion of
    <q>operation</q>.

            <idx><h>Operation</h><h>binary</h></idx>
        on a set <m>G</m> is a function
        <m>G \times G \rightarrow G</m> that assigns to each pair <m>(a,b) \in G \times G</m> a unique element
        <m>a \circ b</m>, or <m>ab</m> in <m>G</m>,
        called the <term>composition</term>
        of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <remark>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Notice that the word ''composition'' is now used to denote any operation on the elements of a set,
          and not just composition of functions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the law of composition on a set is a basic algebraic operation such as multiplication or addition,
          we'll call it with its usual name.
          When it isn't, we will often refer to <m>a \circ b</m> as the
          <q>product</q>
          of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>
          (as we did in the Permutations chapter).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </remark>
  <p>
    In the Modular Arithmetic chapter we introduced what properties a set and operation must have to be called a group:
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Groups_group_prop">
    <statement>
      <p>
        What are the four properties a set <m>G</m> and a binary operation must exhibit in order for the set to be a group under that binary operation?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    Building on our previous discussion,
    we now proudly present the following formal definition.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>

        {group_definition} A <term>group</term>
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>definition</h></idx>
        <m>(G, \circ )</m> is a set <m>G</m> together with a law of composition
        <m>(a,b) \mapsto a \circ b</m> that satisfies the following axioms.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The set <m>G</m> is <term>closed</term>
              under the law of composition.
              That is,
              <me>
                \forall a,b \in G, a \circ b = c \mbox{ for some }  c \in G
              </me>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There exists an element <m>e \in G</m>,
              called the <term>identity element</term>
                <idx><h>Element</h><h>identity</h></idx>,
                <idx><h>Identity</h><h>element</h></idx>
              such that for any element <m>a \in G</m>
              <me>
                e \circ a = a \circ e = a
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              For each element <m>a \in G</m>,
              there exists an <term>inverse element</term>
                <idx><h>Element</h><h>inverse</h></idx>
                <idx><h>Inverse</h><h>element</h></idx>
              in G, denoted by <m>a^{-1}</m>, such that
              <me>
                a \circ a^{-1} = a^{-1} \circ a = e
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The law of composition is <term>associative</term>.
              That is,
              <me>
                (a \circ b) \circ c = a \circ (b \circ c)
              </me>
              for <m>a, b, c \in G</m>.

      When the group operation is obvious or has been previously specified,
      we may denote the group by <m>G</m> rather than <m>(G,\circ)</m>.
      For instance,
      the group of integers under addition is typically denoted by
      <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> and not <m>({\mathbb Z},+)</m>,
      since the operation <m>+</m> is understood.

    One very important class of groups is the commutative groups,
    which are given their own special designation:
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        {abelian_group} A group <m>(G,\circ)</m> with the property that <m>a \circ b = b \circ a</m> for all
        <m>a,
        b \in G</m> is called <term>abelian</term>
            <idx><h>Abelian group</h></idx>

        <fn>
        In honor of Neils Henrik Abel (1802-1829),
        an astounding mathematician who sadly died very young of tuberculosis.
        There is some discussion among mathematicians over whether <sq>abelian</sq> should be capitalized.
        The word has become so common in mathematics that it's usually treated as a regular word and not a proper name.
        This should be considered as a special honor to Abel,
        since his name has become part of the fundamental language of mathematics.
        </fn> or <term>commutative</term>.
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>commutative</h></idx>
        Groups not satisfying this property are said to be <term>non-abelian</term>
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>non-abelian</h></idx>
        or <term>noncommutative</term>.

  </definition>

    Finally, based on our discussion before about the order of sets, we have:
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        {group_order} A group is <term>finite</term>,
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>finite</h></idx>
        or has <term>finite order</term>,
        if it contains a finite number of elements The <em>order</em>
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>order of</h></idx>
            <idx><h>Order</h><h>of a group</h></idx>
        of a finite group is the number of elements that it contains.
        If <m>G</m> is a group containing <m>n</m> elements, we write <m>|G| = n</m>.
        A group that is not finite is called <term>infinite</term>,
        and such a group is said to be of
        <term>infinite order</term>.
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>infinite</h></idx>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The group <m>{\mathbb Z}_5</m> is a finite group of order 5, so <m>|{\mathbb Z}|_5=5</m>;
    while the integers <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> form an infinite group under addition,
    and we sometimes write <m>|{\mathbb Z}| = \infty</m>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        {trivial_group} The <term>trivial group</term>,
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>trivial</h></idx>
        consists of the single element <m>e</m>
        (or <m>{\var id}</m>, in our previous notation).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Groups_trivial">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that the trivial group is in fact a group according to <xref ref="definition_Groups_group_definition">Definition</xref>.
