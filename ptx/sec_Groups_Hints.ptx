  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_Groups_ident">Exercise</xref>: For the
    <q>if</q>
    part, assume that <m>g \circ h = h</m>,
    and use this to show that <m>g = e</m>.
    Multiply both sides of the assumed equation by <m>h^{-1}</m>.
    You will need to use associativity and properties of inverses and the identity to obtain the result.
    For the
    <q>only if</q>
    part, assume that <m>g=e</m> and use this fact to show that <m>g \circ h = h</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_Groups_cayley">Exercise</xref>: Prove by contradiction.
    Suppose that for row
    <q><m>g</m></q>, the entries in columns
    <q><m>h</m></q>
    and
    <q><m>h'</m></q>
    are the same, where <m>h \neq h'</m>.
    Then what equation must be true?
    Show this equation leads to a contradiction.

  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_Groups_group_abelian">Exercise</xref> In general,
    the way to prove statements like this is to multiply both sides of the equation by the same thing.
    In this case, you may multiply by <m>ab</m>.
    Some additional multiplications will give you the result <m>ba=ab</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_Groups_90">Exercise</xref>: Use the fact that <m>a^k = a^l</m> for <m>k \neq l</m>.
    You may assume that <m>k \lt l</m> in your proof.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_Groups_OrderEltCyclic">Exercise</xref>: Write <m>\bmod(m,n)</m> as <m>m + kn</m>,
    where <m>k</m> is an integer.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Additional exercises:</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="ex_Groups_quat">Exercise</xref>: You may obtain 4 cyclic subgroups of order 2 (why?) To look for more subgroups,
    suppose for instance there is a subgroup that contains both <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>.
    What other elements must it contain?
    Do the same for <m>i</m> and <m>k</m>,
    <m>j</m> and <m>k</m>, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="ex_eoc_evenInv">Exercise</xref>: This is a counting argument.
    Prove by contradiction.
    Assume the contrary, and pair each group element with its inverse.
    The entire group is the union of these pairs, plus the identity.
    What does this tell you about the order of the group?
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="ex_eoc_abelian1">Exercise</xref>: Multiply the equation by some well-chosen inverses.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="ex_eoc_abelian2">Exercise</xref>: You may use <xref ref="ex_eoc_abelian1">Exercise</xref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="ex_Groups_2elt">Exercise</xref>: In fact,
    such a group must have at most two elements.
    Do you see why?
