    In mathematics one often encounters sums everywhere.
    Sometimes these sums have very few terms,
    but occasionally the sums can reach hundreds,
    thousands or even an infinite number of terms.
    In these cases,
    rather than listing each and every term or listing the first several terms and assuming the pattern is obvious,
    one can represent a sum using <term>summation notation</term>,
    often referred to as <term>sigma notation</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sigma notation has four main parts:
    the <em>index variable</em>,
    the <em>starting value</em>, the <em>final value</em>
    and the <em>formula</em>.
    These parts are illustrated in the following example.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="example_SigmaNotation_Sigma1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider:
        <me>
          \sum _{i=1}^{10}(i+2)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case,
        the <m>\Sigma</m> symbol lets us know that this is a sum.
        The <m>i=1</m> serves two functions.
        It tells us that the index variable is <m>i</m>,
        and that <m>i</m> has a starting value of 1.
        The <m>10</m> is the final value,
        and the <m>(i+2)</m> to the right of the <m>\Sigma</m> is the formula.
        The <m>i</m> in the formula,
        takes each integer value from the starting value (1) to the final value (10).
        Therefore we have:
        <me>
          \sum _{i=1}^{10}(i+2) = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12=75
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    This notation has a lot of flexibility.
    For example, the sum's formula can be a constant value:
    <me>
      \sum _{i=1}^{10}5 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 50
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Or we could have the index as an exponent:
    <me>
      \sum _{i=1}^{10}(2^i) = 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6+ 2^7+ 2^8+ 2^9+ 2^{10}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now all the examples so far have a numerical value that can be calculated.
    However, summation notation can also be used to express functions of variables such as:
    <me>
      \sum _{i=1}^{10}(x^i)= x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6+ x^7+ x^8+ x^9+ x^{10}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that any variables in the formula that do not match the index are left as variables
    (such as <m>x</m> in the previous example).
    While we do not know what the sum value is other than in terms of <m>x</m>,
    we can much more concisely state the sum in sigma notation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another typical use for the index in the formula is to denote an index in a coefficient.
    Consider the polynomial:
    <me>
      ax^2 + bx + c
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of using a different letter,
    we can use a subscript to denote a different value but use the same letter:
    <me>
      a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    And when we use subscripts,
    we can use the index in the formula to denote that subscript.
    <me>
      \sum_{i=0}^{2}a_ix^i
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Changing the starting and/or final values does not affect the pattern of the formula,
    but it does change the number of terms and any index values used in that formula.
    Take one of the previous examples:
    <me>
      \sum _{i=1}^{10}i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    If we were to change the <m>i=1</m> to <m>i=4</m> then the sum would lose terms 1,2,3:
    <me>
      \sum _{i=4}^{10}i = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, if we were to also change the 10 to 6, it would lose the terms 10,9,8 and 7;
    <me>
      \sum _{i=4}^{6}i = 4 + 5 + 6
    </me>.
