  <title>More advice on induction and strong induction proofs</title>
  <p>
    <term>Should I use ordinary induction or strong induction?</term>
    With some standard types of problems (e.g., sum formulas) it is clear ahead of time what type of induction is
    <em>likely</em> to be required,
    but usually this question answers itself during the exploratory/scratch phase of the argument.
    In the induction step you will need to reach the <m>k+1</m> case,
    and you should ask yourself which of the previous cases you need to get there.
    If all you need to prove the <m>k+1</m> case is the case <m>k</m> of the statement,
    then ordinary induction is appropriate.
    If two preceding cases, <m>k-1</m> and <m>k</m>,
    are necessary to get to <m>k+1</m>,
    then (a weak form of) strong induction is appropriate.
    If one needs the full range of preceding cases (i.e., all cases <m>n=1,2,\dots,k</m>),
    then the full force of strong induction is needed.

    <term>How many base cases are needed?</term>
    The number of base cases to be checked depends on how far back one needs to
    <q>look</q>
    in the induction step.
    In standard induction proofs (e.g., for summation formulas) the induction step requires only the immediately preceding case (i.e., the case <m>n=k</m>),
    so a single base case is enough to start the induction.

      <li>
        <p>
          For Fibonacci-type problems,
          the induction step usually requires the result for the two preceding cases,
          <m>n=k</m> and <m>n=k-1</m>.
          To get the induction started,
          one therefore needs to know the result for two consecutive cases,
          e.g., <m>n=1</m> and <m>n=2</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In postage stamp type problems,
          getting the result for <m>n=k+1</m> might require knowing the result for <m>n=k-2</m> and <m>n=k-6</m>, say.
          This amounts to
          <q>looking back</q>
          <m>7</m> steps
          (namely <m>n=k,k-1,\dots,k-6</m>),
          so <m>7</m> consecutive cases are needed to get the induction started.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand,
          in problems involving the full strength of the strong induction hypothesis (i.e., if in the induction step one needs to assume the result for <em>all</em>
          preceding cases <m>n=k,k-1,\dots,1</m>),
          a single base case may be sufficient.
          An example is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

    <term>How do I write the induction step?</term>
    As in the case of ordinary induction,
    at the beginning of the induction step
    <em>state precisely what you are assuming,
    including any constraints on the induction variable <m>k</m></em>.
    Without an explicitly stated assumption,
    the argument is incomplete.
    The appropriate induction hypothesis depends on the nature of the problem and the type of induction used.
    Here are some common ways to start out an induction step:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <q>Let <m>k\in \NN</m> be given and assume <m>P(k)</m> is true.</q>
          (typical form for standard induction proofs)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <q>Let <m>k\ge 2</m> be given and assume <m>P(n)</m> holds for <m>n=k-1</m> and <m>n=k</m>.</q>
          (typical form for induction involving recurrences)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <q>Let <m>k\in \NN</m> be given and assume <m>P(n)</m> holds for <m>n=1,2,\dots,k</m>.</q>
          (typical form for representation problems)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
