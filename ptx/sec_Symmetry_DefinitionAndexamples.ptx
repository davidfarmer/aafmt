  <title>Definition and examples</title>
  <p>
    In plane geometry we talk about various shapes:
    triangles, rectangles, pentagons, and so on.
    Shapes are important because real objects have shapes (duh),
    and objects are important.
    What would life be without triangles?
  </p>
  <p>
    Now suppose you and your friend cut an equilateral triangle out of a piece of plain white paper and put it on the table.
    Then you tell your friend to go out of the room.
    While she's gone, you take the triangle and move it,
    but in such a way that it looks exactly the same.
    You can do this by rotating the triangle,
    or flipping it over, or by some combination of these two actions.
    When your friend comes back into the room,
    although the triangle has been moved there's no way for her to tell.
    This type of motion is called a
    <em>symmetry operation</em>.
    Clearly we may perform symmetry operations on other objects besides equilateral triangles,
    but only if the shape of the object has some kind of regularity.
    In the following discussion,
    we will explore the relationship between shapes and symmetry operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    We've given an intuitive picture of what symmetry means<ndash/>now let's try to translate that into mathematics.
    We start with a definition:
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        {symmDef} A <term>symmetry</term><idx><h>Symmetry</h><h>definition</h></idx> of a geometrical figure is a rearrangement of the figure that (i) preserves distances and angles between points of the figure,
        and (ii) leaves the appearance and location of the figure unchanged.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <remark>
    <p>
      The meaning of
      <q>preserves distances</q>
      can be expressed more precisely as follows.
      Take any two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> of the original figure.
      The figure is then rearranged so that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sent to points <m>A'</m> and <m>B'</m> respectively.
      Then in order for the rearrangement to be a symmetry,
      the distance between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> must always be equal to the distance between <m>A'</m> and <m>B'</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, the meaning of
      <q>preserves angles</q>
      can be expressed more precisely as follows.
      Take any three points <m>A, B, C</m> of the original figure.
      The figure is then rearranged so that <m>A, B, C</m> are sent to <m>A', B', C'</m> respectively.
      In order for the rearrangement to be a symmetry,
      <m>\angle ABC</m> must always be equal to
      <m>\angle A'B'C'</m> regardless of the choice of <m>A, B, C</m>.<fn>
      It can be shown mathematically that a rearrangement that preserves distances must necessarily preserve angles as well.
      So strictly speaking,
      the additional angle preservation requirement is not necessary.
      </fn>
    </p>
  </remark>
  <p>
    A motion that preserves distances and angles between parts of a figure is also called a
    <term>rigid motion</term>.
        <idx><h>Rigid motion</h></idx>
    Intuitively,
    you may think of the figure as a rigid object, and the
    <q>rearrangement</q>
    is effected by moving the rigid object in some fashion.
    For example,
    any <term>rotation</term><idx><h>Rotation</h><h>as rigid motion</h></idx> that does not change the shape of the object is a rigid motion.

  <example xml:id="example_Symmetry_mercedeslogo">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the Mercedes logo shown in <xref ref="fig_mercedes">Figure</xref>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Imagine pinning the center of the logo to the page and spinning the logo
              <m>120^\circ</m> counterclockwise about its center.
              The resulting image looks exactly like the original,
              because each of the three points on the circumference moves to the location of the next point over.
              So a <m>120^\circ</m> counterclockwise rotation is a symmetry of the logo.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you rotate the image <m>180^\circ</m> counterclockwise about the center,
              the resulting image is no longer identical to the original
              (try it!).
              So a <m>180^\circ</m> counterclockwise rotation is not a symmetry of the logo.

          <li>
            <p>
              We could also
              <q>flip over</q>
              the logo (like flipping a pancake) in such a way that the left half moves to the right,
              and vice versa.
              Then the vertical point stays in the same place while the left and right point exchange positions,
              leaving the appearance of the logo unchanged.
              The motion has the same effect as if the logo were <term>reflected</term>
              across the vertical axis.
                <idx><h>Reflection (rigid motion)</h></idx>
            After the motion, the logo looks the same.

              <term>translations</term><idx><h>Translation</h><h>as a rigid motion</h></idx> in any direction is a rigid motion,
              and the resulting image looks the same as the original,
              but the location is different.
              Hence this shift is <em>not</em>
              a symmetry of the Mercedes logo.

    This is not the first time we've played with symmetries of a figure.
    At the end of Chapter 1, we saw that the complex sixth roots of unity determined a regular hexagon in the complex plane,
    and that complex multiplication and complex conjugation could be used to rotate or reflect the hexagon.
    Let us investigate the hexagon a bit further.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_hex60rot">
    <caption>Hexagon and  <m>60^\circ</m> rotation</caption>
    <image width="93%" source="images/hexABCDEF_1.png"/>
  </figure>
  <example xml:id="example_Symmetry_hexagon">
    <statement>
      <p>
        <xref ref="fig_hex60rot">Figure</xref>
        shows a <m>60^\circ</m> counterclockwise rotation of a regular hexagon where the vertices of the hexagon are labeled <m>A,B,C,D,E,F</m>.
        (Notice how the letters run <em>counterclockwise</em> around the hexagon.
        We will consistently follow this pattern.
        The reason is that in mathematical convention,
        a counterclockwise rotation is considered as <em>positive</em>,
        while a clockwise rotation is considered as <em>negatve</em>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The rotation moves <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>,
        <m>B</m> to <m>C</m>, and so on.
        Now of course there are other points on our figure,
        namely all the points on the line segments between the vertices.
        But notice that if we account for where the vertices are moved to,
        then the movement of the line segments is automatically accounted for.
        If we know where <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are moved to,
        we know exactly where <m>\overline{AB}</m> is.
        Therefore, our <m>60</m> degree rotation can be defined by the movement of the vertices <m>\{A,B,C,D,E,F\}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now if we input a point from <m>\{A,B,C,D,E,F\}</m>,
        our rotation outputs a point from <m>\{A,B,C,D,E,F\}</m>.
        We have used this
        <q>input-output</q>
        language before, namely in the Functions chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, we can think of the <m>60</m> degree rotation as a function <m>r_{60}</m> from <m>\{A,B,C,D,E,F\} \to \{A,B,C,D,E,F\}</m>,
        where (using ordered pair notation)
        <me>
          r_{60} = \{ (A,B), (B,C), (C,D), (D,E), (E,F), (F,A) \}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before leaving this example,
        we make note of a peculiarity that has tripped up many a student.
        If you compare the 'before' hexagon
        (shown at left in <xref ref="fig_hex60rot">Figure</xref>)
        with the <sq>after</sq> hexagon
        (shown at right),
        it appears that the original vertex <m>B</m> has been relabeled as' <m>A</m>,
        <m>C</m> has been relabeled as <m>B</m>, and so on.
        However, according to our function we say that <m>A</m> goes to <m>B</m>,
        not <m>B</m> goes to <m>A</m>.
        This is because we're thinking of symmetry as a <em>motion</em>
        rather than a relabeling.
        The fact that original vertex <m>B</m> is relabeled as <m>A</m> means that <m>A</m> moved to <m>B</m>,
        and not vice versa.
        So you should take care in future examples<ndash/>whenever you see a vertex <m>X</m> being relabeled as <m>Y</m> this means that
        <m>Y \rightarrow X</m>, and not vice versa.<fn>
        Actually, we could have defined symmetries as relabelings rather than motions,
        and all of the conclusions of this chapter would still hold.
        We'd just have to rewrite all of our tableaus to reflect this different convention.

    exemplifies a general property of symmetries:
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="proposition_Symmetry_SymmBijection">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>S</m> is the set of points that represent a figure,
        all symmetries of the figure are bijections from <m>S \to S</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Since the result of any symmetry acting on <m>S</m> must be all of <m>S</m>,
      then every point of <m>S</m> must be in the range of <m>S</m>.
      Thus any symmetry is onto.
      Furthermore,
      the symmetry must map two different points to two different points,
      since the distance between points must be left unchanged by the symmetry.
      Hence any symmetry is one-to-one.
      So since any symmetry is both onto and one-to-one,
      it follows that any symmetry is a bijection.

    <xref ref="proposition_Symmetry_SymmBijection">Proposition</xref>
