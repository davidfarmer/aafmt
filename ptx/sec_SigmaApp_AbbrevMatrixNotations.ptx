  <title>Abbreviated matrix notations</title>
  <p>
    In the following discussion, we will be seeing lots of sums involving matrices.
    This being the case,
    it's worth our while to try to simplify our notation.
    In our expression for <m>C=AB</m>, we had:
    <me>
      {c}_{i,j}= \sum_{k=1}^n a_{i,k} b_{k,j}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, notice that the index <m>k</m> runs over all columns of <m>A</m> and all rows of <m>B</m>
    (recall that matrix multiplication is only defined if the number of columns of <m>A</m> is equal to the number of rows of <m>B</m>).
    This being the case,
    we don't really need to mention that <m>k</m> runs from 1 to <m>n</m><ndash/>we should simply understand that the index <m>k</m> runs over all possible values.
    We can therefore convey the same information by simply writing:
    <me>
      {c}_{i,j}= \sum_{k} a_{i,k} b_{k,j}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This makes more complicated matrix multiplications much simpler.
    For example,
    if <m>D = (AB)C</m> where <m>A</m> is <m>n \times p</m>,
    <m>B</m> is <m>p \times q</m>,
    and <m>C</m> is <m>q \times r</m> instead of
    <me>
      {d}_{i,m}= \sum_{j=1}^q \left( \sum_{k=1}^p a_{i,k} b_{k,j} \right) c_{j,m}
    </me>,
    we may write
    <me>
      {d}_{i,m}= \sum_{j} \left( \sum_{k} a_{i,k} b_{k,j} \right) c_{j,m}
    </me>,
    which further simplifies to
    <me>
      {d}_{i,m}= \sum_{j,k}  a_{i,k} b_{k,j} c_{j,m}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We could write either <m>\sum_{j,k}</m> or <m>\sum_{k,j}</m>:
    all possible values of <m>k</m> and <m>j</m> are summed over,
    so it doesn't matter which order we mention the indices.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is an even more abbreviated notation that is commonly used in physics,
    called <term>Einstein notation</term> (yes,
    it's that Einstein!) Notice that in our expression for <m>{c}_{i,j}</m>,
    the subscript <m>k</m> is <em>repeated</em>:
    that is, it appears as a subscript on <m>a_{i,k}</m> and on <m>b_{k,j}</m>.
    Similarly, in our expression for
    <m>{d}_{i,m}</m> the summed subscripts (<m>j</m> and <m>k</m>) are also repeated:
    both appear as subscripts in two terms.
    The Einstein rule may be summarized as:
    <me>
      \text{ Repeated indices are assumed to be summed. }
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    So for example, the expression
    <me>
      {d}_{i,m}= \sum_{j} \left( \sum_{k} a_{i,k} b_{k,j} \right) c_{j,m}
    </me>
    in Einstein notation simplifies to:
    <me>
      {d}_{i,m}=  a_{i,k} b_{k,j} c_{j,m}
    </me>.

    In the following sections we will use the first type of abbreviated notation
    (not Einstein notation).
