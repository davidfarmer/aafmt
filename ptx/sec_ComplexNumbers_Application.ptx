    <title>General remarks on the usefulness of complex numbers</title>
    <p>
      We have already discussed that it took some time for complex numbers to be generally accepted by mathematicians,
      who tended to have a preference for
      <q>pure</q>
      numbers such as the integers.
      But complex numbers have had their revenge.
      Today the
      <q>purest</q>
      form of mathematics, namely number theory,
      is heavily dependent on complex numbers.
      The famous Fermat's Last Theorem<idx><h>Fermat</h><h>last theorem</h></idx> was proved using techniques that involved complex numbers.<fn>
      See \url{http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Fermat's_last_theorem.html} for some of the long and sordid history of Fermat's Last Theorem.
      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      But quite apart from pure mathematics,
      complex numbers have proved to be extremely practical.
      Complex numbers are indispensable tools for scientists and engineers.
      Virtually all of modern physics is based on complex numbers.
      Engineers build bridges using complex numbers.
      Without complex numbers,
      there would probably be no computers,
      cell phones or most other electronics.
      A strong argument could be made that complex numbers are even more useful than
      <q>real</q>
      numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of the practical usefulness of complex numbers comes from their close relationship with the trigonometric functions cosine and sine.
      We have seen a little bit of this already in the representation <m>z=r\cis\theta</m>.
      Complex numbers give a powerful way to express complicated functions of sine and cosine in a very simple way.
      We will give an introduction of this in the next section<ndash/>you may see it again,
      or have already seen it, in your differential equations course.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec_ComplexNumbers_Application_Phasors">
    <title>Complex numbers in electrical engineering: phasors</title>
    <p>
      We have already seen there is a close relationship between complex numbers and the trigonometric functions sine and cosine.
      This relationship is the basis for much of the usefulness of complex numbers <mdash/> as we shall explain in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="fig_ComplexNumbers_1">Figure</xref>
      shows the graphs of the cosine and sine functions.
      They look like waves: for instance,
      the graph of <m>y = \cos(t)</m> is a wave that includes the point <m>(0,1)</m>.
      The <em><em>amplitude</em></em>
          <idx><h>Amplitude</h></idx>
      of this wave is 1.
      The <em><em>period</em></em>
          <idx><h>Period</h></idx>
      of this wave is <m>2\pi</m> radians.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_ComplexNumbers_1">
      <caption>Graphs of cosine and sine</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="images/cos_sin.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Note that some references use the word
      <q>wavelength</q>
      instead of
      <q>period</q>.
          <idx><h>Wavelength</h></idx>
      This is because they are considering equations like
      <m>y = \cos(x)</m> where the independent variable <m>x</m> represents distance.
      We are considering the independent variable to be time:
      so it is appropriate to use the word
      <q>period</q>
      instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, there are cosine and sine waves with different periods.
      However, in this section we will <em>only</em>
      be looking at cosine and sine waves with period <m>2\pi</m>.
      We re-emphasize: all the cosine and sine waves in this chapter
      (and any that you use in the homework problems)
      have period <m>2 \pi</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we can create other waves by using the cosine as a
      <q>parent function</q>. For instance, the graph of
      <m>y = A \cos ( t + \theta)</m> where <m>A > 0</m> is similar to the graph of <m>y = \cos(t)</m>,
      with the following differences:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The amplitude is <m>A</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <term>phase shift</term>
              <idx><h>Phase shift</h></idx>
            (relative to the cosine curve) is <m>\theta</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <remark>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            You may have studied
            <q>parent functions</q>
            in high school, and if so you may remember that the graph of
            <m>y = f(t+c)</m> is shifted to the <em>left</em>
            compared to the graph of <m>y = f(t)</m>.
            It follows that a positive phase shift will shift the graph to the <em>left</em>,
            while a negative phase shift will shift it to the <em>right</em>
            (see <xref ref="fig_ComplexNumbers_2">Figure</xref>).<fn>
            You should be careful when you encounter the term
            <q>phase shift</q>
            in other books,
            because some books define a positive phase shift as moving the graph to the <em>right</em>.
            This is not wrong: it's just different terminology.
            </fn>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the variable <m>t</m> is considered as time,
            then <m>y = A \cos ( t + \theta)</m> is
            <em>advanced</em> by <m>\theta</m>
            (corresponding to a left shift of the graph),
            while <m>y = A \cos ( t - \theta)</m> is
            <em>delayed</em> by <m>\theta</m>

      In summary, amplitude and phase are two important properties of cosine and sine waves;
      and in fact the amplitude and phase uniquely determine the actual wave,
      as you saw in <xref ref="exercise_ComplexNumbers_wave1">Exercises</xref>
      and <xref ref="exercise_ComplexNumbers_waves"></xref>.
      Now earlier in this chapter,
      we saw a different mathematical object that was characterized by amplitude and phase.
      Naturally, we're referring to the complex numbers.
      We will now make a deep connection between these two types of mathematical objects that,
      on the surface, are very different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that the <em>real part</em>
      of the complex number <m>z = a + bi</m> is <m>a</m>,
      and the <em>imaginary part</em> is <m>b</m>.
      We also use the notation Re<m>[z]</m> to denote the real part of the complex number <m>z</m>,
      and the notation Im<m>[z]</m> to denote the imaginary part.
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise_ComplexNumbers_43">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that Re<m>[A \cis\theta \cdot \cis( t)] = A \cos ( t + \theta)</m>. (*Hint*)

        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      The previous two exercises show that:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A cosine wave with amplitude <m>A</m> and phase shift <m>\theta</m> can be represented as the real part of the complex number
            <m>A \cis\theta</m> times the complex function <m>\cis(t)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A sine wave with amplitude <m>A</m> and phase shift <m>\theta</m> can be represented as the imaginary part of the complex number
            <m>A \cis\theta</m> times the complex function <m>\cis(t)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also understand this situation in terms of two-dimensional vectors with the help of <xref ref="fig_ComplexNumbers_3">Figure</xref>.
      We've already shown how complex numbers can be seen as two-dimensional vectors:
      in particular, the complex number
      <m>\cis\theta</m> is identified with <m>\cos\theta</m><em>i</em>
      + <m>\sin\theta</m><em>j</em>.
      As <m>t</m> varies, the point
      <m>\cis(t+\theta)</m> moves around the unit circle,and the real part of
      <m>\cis(t + \theta)</m> is the projection of the moving point onto the <m>x</m>-axis.
      In other words,
      the cosine wave on the right side of <xref ref="fig_ComplexNumbers_3">Figure</xref>
      tells us the vector's horizontal distance to the <m>y</m>-axis as a function of time <m>t</m>.

    <p>
      Now when two waves cross each other they produce a wave of a different shape<ndash/>we may see this in water waves at the beach or pool
      (or physics class).
      This is called <em><em>wave superposition</em></em>.
          <idx><h>Wave superposition</h></idx>
      We will now see how complex numbers make it easy to compute the shape of this new wave.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec_ComplexNumbers_Application_Mandelbrot">
    <title>Complex numbers and fractals: the Mandelbrot set</title>
    <p>
      The intricate <em>Mandelbrot set</em>
          <idx><h>Mandelbrot set</h></idx>
      (see <xref ref="mandelbrot">Figure</xref>) is a beautiful application of complex numbers.
      The Mandelbrot set is defined by means of <em>iteration</em>
      of the function <m>f(z) = z^2 + c</m>.
      The definition is a little complicated:
      we show how it works using a couple of examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      First consider <m>c=1</m>, so <m>f(z) = z^2 + 1</m>.
      We start with <m>z=0</m>, which gives <m>f(0) = 1</m>;
      and we iterate by evaluating the function on the result of the previous evaluation.
      So we compute <m>f(1) = 2, f(2) = 5, f(5) = 26, \ldots</m>.. It is clear that <m>|f(z)|</m> is getting larger and larger after repeated iterations.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, if we use <m>c=i</m> and start with <m>z=0</m>,
      we get <m>f(0) = i</m> at first,
      and repeated iteration gives
      <m>f(i) = -1+i, f(-1+i) =- i, f(-i) = -1 + i, \ldots</m> so that this time <m>|f(z)|</m> doesn't continue to grow indefinitely after repeated iterations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mandelbrot set is defined to be the set of values <m>c</m> for which the iterations of
      <m>f(z) = z^2 + c</m> starting from <m>z=0</m> do <em>not</em>
      grow indefinitely upon iteration.
      Thus <m>i</m> is in the Mandelbrot set, while <m>1</m> is not.

          In the definition of the Mandelbrot set,
          we mentioned that you have to check whether the iterations
          <q>grow indefinitely</q>. The question, is, How far do you have to check?
          We can actually give an answer:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <p>
                Given any two complex numbers <m>z,w</m>, show that:
                <me>
                  |z + w| \le |z| + |w|
                </me>.
                This is called the <em>triangle inequality</em><idx><h>triangle inequality</h><h>for complex numbers</h></idx> for complex numbers
                (it is closely related to the <sq>triangle inequality</sq> for vectors). (*Hint*)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Prove the following variation of the triangle inequality: Given two complex numbers <m>z,w</m> then <m>|z| \ge |z-w| - |w|</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Suppose that <m>|c| \lt 2</m>,
                and suppose that <m>z \ge 2</m>.
                Use (b) to show that <m>|z^2 + c| > |z|</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                In order to guarantee that a number <m>c</m> is in the Mandelbrot set,
                all we have to do is show that one of the iterates of the function
                <m>f(z) = z^2 + c</m> is larger than a given positive number <m>r</m>.
                What is the value of <m>r</m>?
