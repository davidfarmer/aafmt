      "I'm all about that, all about that bass I'm all about that,
      all about that bass I'm all about that bass,
      no treble We gon' take it to a whole another level" (Source: "All About That Bass", Meghan Trainor)

      We grew up working with numbers in base <m>10</m>. so let's explore the how we represent numbers,
      find the <m>k'th</m> decimal of integer and non-integer numbers,
      and deriving divisibility rules of integers all in base 10.
      The problem is that bases come in all different sizes,
      so we will also delve into converting integers and non-integers from base <m>10</m> to other bases and vice versa!
