  <title>Non-formula induction proofs</title>
  <p>
    Below is a sample proof of the statement that any <m>n</m>-element set (i.e., any set with <m>n</m> elements) has <m>2^n</m> subsets.
    This illustrates a case where the result we seek to prove is not a formula,
    but a statement that must be expressed verbally,
    and where the induction step requires some verbal explanation,
    and not just a chain of equalities.
    Additional practice problems follow below.

  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For all <m>n\in\NN</m>, the following holds:
        <me>
          {\text{ Any \(n\)-element set has \(2^n\) subsets. } } \tag{\(P(n)\)}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      (<em>By induction</em>):
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Base case:</em> Since any <m>1</m>-element set has <m>2</m> subsets,
      namely the empty set and the set itself,
      and <m>2^1=2</m>, the statement <m>P(n)</m> is true for <m>n=1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Induction step:</em>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>k\in\NN</m> be given and suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true,
            i.e., that any <m>k</m>-element set has <m>2^k</m> subsets.
            We seek to show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true as well,
            i.e., that any <m>(k+1)</m>-element set has <m>2^{k+1}</m> subsets.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>A</m> be a set with <m>k+1</m> elements.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>a</m> be an element of <m>A</m>, and let <m>A'=A-\{a\}</m>
            (so that <m>A'</m> is a set with <m>k</m> elements).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We classify the subsets of <m>A</m> into two types: (I) subsets that do
            <em>not</em> contain <m>a</m>,
            and (II) subsets that do contain <m>a</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The subsets of type (I) are exactly the subsets of the set <m>A'</m>.
            Since <m>A'</m> has <m>k</m> elements,
            the induction hypothesis can be applied to this set and we conclude that there are <m>2^k</m> subsets of type (I).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The subsets of type (II) are exactly the sets of the form <m>B=B'\cup \{a\}</m>,
            where <m>B'</m> is a subset of <m>A'</m>.
            By the induction hypothesis there are <m>2^k</m> such sets <m>B'</m>,
            and hence <m>2^k</m> subsets of type (II).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since there are <m>2^k</m> subsets of each of the two types,
            the total number of subsets of <m>A</m> is <m>2^k+2^k=2^{k+1}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>A</m> was an arbitrary <m>(k+1)</m>-element set,
            we have proved that any <m>(k+1)</m>-element set has <m>2^{k+1}</m> subsets.
            Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true, completing the induction step.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Conclusion:</em> By the principle of induction,
      <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n\in\NN</m>.
    </p>
