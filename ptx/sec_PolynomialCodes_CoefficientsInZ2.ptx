  <title>Polynomials with coefficients in <m>\mathbb{Z}_2</m></title>
  <p>
    We are used to polynomials with coefficients that are integers or real numbers.
    But as we mentioned in the previous chapter,
    it is also possible to have polynomials with coefficients from other number systems.
    In this chapter,
    we will be looking particularly at the the set of polynomials with coefficients in <m>\mathbb{Z}_2</m>:
    this set is denoted by <m>\mathbb{Z}_2[x]</m>.
    For a polynomial in <m>\mathbb{Z}_2[x]</m>,
    all coefficients are either 0 or 1.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The polynomials in <m>\mathbb{Z}_2[x]</m> are:
        <ol type="">
          <li>
            <p>
              The constant polynomials: 1 and 0 (there are only 2)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The linear polynomials: <m>x</m> and <m>x+1</m> (there are only 2)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The quadratic polynomials: <m>x^2, x^2+1, x^2 + x</m>,<m>x^2 + x+1</m>,
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        And so on for higher-degree polynomials.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p>
            How many different polynomials in <m>\mathbb{Z}_2[x]</m> have degree 3?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            How many different polynomials in <m>\mathbb{Z}_2[x]</m> have degree 4?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            How many different polynomials in
            <m>\mathbb{Z}_2[x]</m> have degree <m>n</m>, where <m>n \ge 1</m>?
            Make a guess.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prove that your guess is correct (<em>Hint</em>: Use induction,
            if you know how.
            Otherwise, you can make a more informal argument.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    A polynomial in <m>\mathbb{Z}_2[x]</m> can also be represented as a
    <term> binary n-tuple</term>
        <idx><h>Binary <m>n</m>-tuple</h></idx>
    (or binary vector) whose entries are 1's and 0's.
    If the degree of the polynomial is <m>n</m>,
    then there must be at least <m>n+1</m> entries in the tuple.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The polynomial <m>f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x</m> can be represented by the binary 4-tuple:
        <m>(1~1~1~0)</m>.
        It can also be represented by the 5-tuple
        <m>(0~1~1~1~0)</m> or the 6-tuple <m>(0~0~1~1~1~0)</m>:
        these representations may be useful when adding or subtracting polynomials,
        as we'll see in a moment.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Addition, subtraction and multiplication are best explained by examples.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(x) = x^2 + x + 1</m> and
        <m>g(x) = x^3   + x + 1</m> be polynomials in <m>\mathbb{Z}_2[x]</m>.
        We may represent <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> by the 4-tuples
        <m>(0~1~1~1)</m> and <m>(1~0~1~1)</m> respectively
        (note that we have used <m>n</m>-tuples of the same length:
        the length is determined by the highest degree of the two polynomials).
        Adding the polynomials is the same as adding corresponding entries of the in mod 2.
        It follows that the sum <m>f(x)+g(x)</m> is:
        <me>
          \left( ~(0\oplus 1)~~~(1\oplus 0)~~(1 \oplus 1)~~~(1 \oplus 1)~\right) = (1~~1~~0~~0)
        </me>,
        which corresponds to the polynomial <m>x^3   + x^2</m>.
        (Actually, when we represent polynomials as <m>n</m>-tuples in this way,
        polynomial addition is identical to addition in <m>\mathbb{Z}_2^n</m>,
        where <m>\mathbb{Z}_2^n = \underbrace{\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \ldots \mathbb{Z}_2}_{n~\text{ times } }</m>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If on the other hand we take <m>f(x) - g(x)</m>,
        we find that we get the same answer (Try it!).
        This will <em>always</em> be the case,
        because in <m>\mathbb{Z}_2</m> addition and subtraction are the
        <em>same</em> operation.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    We will be using these polynomials to represent certain special types of codes,
    as we shall see shortly.
