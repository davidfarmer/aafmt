  <introduction>
    <p>
      We saw in the previous section that <m>R[x]</m> is a ring whenever <m>R</m> is a ring.
      We may ask a similar question about fields: If <m>F</m> is a field,
      then is <m>F[x]</m> also a field?
      We investigate this question in the following exercises.

      Do polynomials have multiplicative inverses?
      Be careful here.
      In high-school algebra or in calculus,
      the polynomial <m>p(x)</m> has a perfectly good multiplicative inverse,
      namely <m>1/p(x)</m>.
      But <m>1/p(x)</m> is not a polynomial,
      so for us it doesn't count!
      For a set of polynomials to be a field,
      the nonzero elements must have inverses that are polynomials themselves.

          Suppose that <m>F</m> is a field.

    <exercise xml:id="exercise_Rings_zdzpa">

      establishes the following proposition:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Rings_nozerodiv">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>F</m> is a field, then <m>F[x]</m> has no zero divisors.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The property of having no zero divisors turns out to be a very important consideration in the process of polynomial division,
      which we discuss in the next section.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here's the result we've been waiting for.
      Now that we've prepared the ground,
      it's not so difficult to prove.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Rings_FTOA">
      <statement>
        <p>
          (<em>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:
          easy part</em>) Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>f(x)</m> be a polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> of degree <m>n</m>.
          Then the equation <m>f(x)=0</m> has at most <m>n</m> solutions:
          that is, there are at most <m>n</m> distinct elements
          <m>\{x_1,\ldots x_n\}</m> of <m>F</m> such that
          <m>f(x_m)=0</m> for <m>1 \le m \le n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>a_1</m> is a solution to <m>f(x)=0</m>.
        Then by <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_polydivides">Proposition</xref>
        it follows that <m>x-a_1</m> divides <m>f(x)</m>.
        Therefore <m>f(x) = (x-a_1) g_{n-1}(x)</m> where the degree of <m>g_{n-1}(x)=n-1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now if <m>a_2 \neq a_1</m> is another solution then using our above result we have
        <me>
          f(a_2) = (a_2 - a_1)g_{n-1}(a_2) = 0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>a_2 - a_1 \neq 0</m>,
        it follows that <m>g_{n-1}(a_2) = 0</m>.
        So we can write <m>g_{n - 1}(x) = (x-a_2)g_{n-2}(x)</m> where the degree of <m>g_2(x) = n-2</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuing in the same way,
        if there are distinct roots <m>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</m> then
        <me>
          f(x) = (x - a_1)(x - a_2)...(x - a_n)g_0
        </me>,
        where the degree of <m>g_0</m> is 0
        (in other words, <m>g_0</m> is a constant.).
        So there can't be any more solutions, <m>a_{n+1}</m>,
        because <m>(x-a_{n+1})</m> doesn't divide <m>g_0</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The previous theorem immediately gives us an extremely important general property of fields:

      Take note of the
      <q>at most</q>
      qualification in <xref ref="proposition_Rings_FTOA">Proposition</xref>.
      There are cases of polynomials in <m>F[x]</m> which do not have
      <em>any</em> roots in <m>F</m>.
      For example, there are polynomials in
      <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m> that have no roots at all in <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m>,
      as the next examples illustrate.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Rings_poly_complex">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the roots of <m>p(x)=2x^2+2x+5</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this is a quadratic polynomial we can use the famous quadratic formula:
          <me>
            x=\frac {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In <m>p(x), a=2, b=2</m>, and <m>c=5</m>.
          We substitute those values into the formula and obtain the following:
          <md>
            <mrow>x\amp =\frac {-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2-4\cdot 2\cdot 5}}{2\cdot 2}=\frac {-2 \pm \sqrt{-36}}{4}=\frac {-2 \pm 6i}{4}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\frac {-1 \pm 3i}{2}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the roots of <m>p(x)</m> are <m>x</m> ={<m>-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{3}{2}i, -\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{2}i</m>}.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The next example is a cubic polynomial in <m>\mathbb{Z}[x]</m>.
      To find the rational roots, we will make use of the following proposition.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Rings_Rationalroots">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x) = a_{n}x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{0}</m> be a polynomial in <m>\mathbb{Z}[x]</m>.
          Any rational roots of <m>f(x)</m> expressed in lowest terms have numerators,
          <m>p</m>,
          which are factors of <m>a_{0}</m> and denominators, <m>q</m>,
          which are factors of <m>a_{n}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(x) = a_{n}x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{0}</m> be a polynomial in
        <m>\mathbb{Z}[x]</m> and suppose that <m>p/q</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m>,
        where the fraction <m>p/q</m> is in lowest terms
        (so <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are relatively prime).
      </p>
      <p>
        First we will show that <m>p</m> is a factor of <m>a_{0}</m>.
        Since <m>p/q</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m> we have <m>f\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)=0</m>,
        which implies
        <me>
          a_{n}\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)^n+a_{n-1}\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)^{n-1}+...+a_{0}=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiplying both sides by <m>q^n</m>, we have,
        <me>
          \left(a_{n}\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)^n+a_{n-1}\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)^{n-1}+...+a_{0}\right)q^n=0
        </me>,
        which simplifies to
        <me>
          a_{n}p^n+a_{n-1}(p^{n-1}q)+...+a_{0}q^n=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This expression can be rearranged to obtain:
        <me>
          p\left(-a_{n}p^{n-1}-a_{n-1}(p^{n-2}q)-...-a_{1}q^{n-1}\right)=a_{0}q^n
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]</m>,
        all the coefficients <m>a_i</m> are also integers.
        <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are also integers.
        Since integers are closed under addition and multiplication,
        it follows that both sides of the above equation are integers.
        Since <m>p</m> divides the left-hand side,
        it must also divide the right-hand side.
        Therefore <m>p</m> divides <m>a_{0}q^n</m>.
        Now <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are relatively prime:
        so in order for <m>p</m> to divide <m>a_{0}q^n</m>,
        it must divide <m>a_0</m>.
        In other words,
        <m>p</m> is a factor of <m>a_{0}</m><mdash/>which is just what we wanted to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out the proof that <m>q</m> is a factor of <m>a_{n}</m> is basically the same,
        if we use a little trick.
        The first equation that we wrote down above was:
        <me>
          a_{n}\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)^n+a_{n-1}\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)^{n-1}+...+a_{0}=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's multiply both sides by <m>(q/p)^n</m>.
        After simplifying, and rearranging we get:
        <me>
          a_{0}\left(\frac {q}{p}\right)^n+a_{1}\left(\frac {q}{p}\right)^{n-1}+...+a_{n}=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, this new equation corresponds exactly to the first equation with the following replacements:
        <me>
          a_n  \rightarrow a_0;\,\, a_{n-1} \rightarrow a_1;\,\, \ldots;\,\, a_0 \rightarrow a_n; \,\, p  \leftrightarrow q
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can then go through the entire previous argument,
        making these replacements.
        We concluded previously that <m>p</m> is a factor of <m>a_0</m><mdash/>so if we apply the identical argument to the equation with replacements,
        we obtain that <m>q</m> is a factor of <m>a_n</m>.
        You may fill in the details in the following exercise.
      </p>
      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Starting with the equation <m>a_{0}\left(q/p\right)^n+a_{1}\left(q/p\right)^{n-1}+...+a_{n}=0</m>,
            give the complete argument which shows that <m>q</m> is a factor of <m>a_n</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </exercise>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Now let's get some practice using <xref ref="proposition_Rings_Rationalroots">Proposition</xref>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the roots of <m>f(x)=3x^3+10x^2+11x+6</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this is a cubic polynomial,
          we can't use the quadratic formula,
          at least not to begin with.
          The coefficients are integers,
          so we may use <xref ref="proposition_Rings_Rationalroots">Proposition</xref>,
          which says that <em>any</em> rational roots of <m>p(x)</m> have numerators that are factors of <m>a_{0}</m> and denominators that are factors of <m>a_{n}</m>.
          This does not guarantee that there are rational roots:
          sometimes polynomials are irreducible,
          but we still try every method possible to find those roots unless we know that we can't reduce the polynomial.
          So we will proceed with trying to find the roots of <m>f(x)</m> using <xref ref="proposition_Rings_Rationalroots">Proposition</xref>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <m>f(x)</m>, possible numerators of any rational roots are:
          <m>p=\pm1, \pm2, \pm3, \pm6</m>.
          The possible denominators are: <m>q=\pm1, \pm3</m>.
          So we have as possible rational roots the following:
          <m>p/q= \pm1, \pm\frac{1}{3}, \pm2, \pm\frac{2}{3},\pm3, \pm6</m>.
          By <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_polydivides">Proposition</xref>,
          if <m>f(p/q)=0</m> then <m>(x-p/q)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>;
          which would make <m>p/q</m> a root of <m>f(x)</m>.
          After testing all possibilities we find the following rational root:
          <m>f(-2)=3(-2)^3+10(-2)^2+11(-2)+6=0</m>.
          Therefore, <m>x=-2</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>(x+2)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>.
          We then use long division to factor <m>f(x)</m>.

      We've seen quite a few fields that are not algebraically closed.
      For example, the rational numbers
      <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> are not algebraically closed, because e.g.
      <m>x^2 - 2</m> has no roots in <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>.
      However, we were able to find a larger field
      (namely <m>\mathbb{R}</m>)
      that contains <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> which has the root that <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> is lacking.
      In this section,
      we'll talk about situations like this in a general context.

    <remark xml:id="remark_Polynomials_transcendental">
      <p>
        It's not so easy to show that elements are transcendental.
        This is because to show that <m>a</m> is transcendental over <m>F</m>,
        you need to show that there's no polynomial whatsoever in <m>F[x]</m> which has <m>a</m> as a root.
        Let's consider in particular the case <m>F = \mathbb{Q}</m>.
        We saw in <xref ref="ComplexNumbers">Chapter</xref>
        that <m>\mathbb{R}</m> has lots of
        <em>irrational</em> numbers,
        but so far we haven't definitely identified any real number that is transcendental over <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1844, Joseph Liouville gave the first proof that a transcendental number exists.
        Liouville constructed a number
        (using infinite series)
        with special properties,
        and was able to show that it's impossible to construct a polynomial in
        <m>\mathbb{Q}[x]</m> that has that number as a root.
        Hermite showed about 30 years later that <m>e</m> was transcendental,
        and <m>\pi</m> was added to the list
        (by Lindemann)
        10 years after that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even today, only a handful of classes of numbers have been shown to be transcendental.
        This is not to say that there aren't lots of them.
        In fact, Georg Cantor in 1874 was able to show that
        <q>almost all</q>
        real numbers are transcendental over <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>.
        This is a fascinating topic,
        and there's lots of information on the Internet if you're interested in pursuing it further
        (one place to look is \url{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TranscendentalNumber.html}).

      A field extension may be algebraic,
      but still contain polynomials that have no roots.
      There's a special term for field extensions which contain roots for
      <em>all</em> their polynomials:

          there exists <m>a \in E</m> such that <m>p(a)=0</m>.
          Then <m>E</m> is an <em>algebraic closure</em><idx><h>Field</h><h>algebraic closure of</h></idx>

    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Rings_realalgclosure">

          <m>\mathbb{C}</m> is an algebraic closure of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.

    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>a+bi \in \mathbb{C}</m> be arbitrary and let <m>p(x)=(x-(a+bi))(x-(a-bi))= x^2-2ax+a^2+b^2\in\mathbb{R}[x]</m>.
        We see that <m>a+bi</m> is a root of <m>p(x)</m>.
        Since <m>a+bi</m> is arbitrary,
        we can say that any element of

        By <xref ref="definition_Rings_defalgfieldextension">Definition</xref>
        this makes <m>\mathbb{C}</m> an algebraic extension of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
        Additionally,

        <m>\mathbb{C}</m> is algebraically closed.

        <m>\mathbb{C}</m> is the algebraic closure of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.

    <title>Applications of algebraic field extensions</title>
    <p>
      We've already seen how field extensions play an important role in mathematics.
      The irrational numbers were first introduced using an algebraic field extension of <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>
      (although later it was discovered that not all irrational numbers are algebraic over <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>).
      Similarly, the complex numbers were created as an algebraic field extension of the real numbers.
      But this is just the beginning.
      Algebraic field extensions have played a pivotal role in a great number of deep mathematical results obtained over the last 200 years.
      Here is a short list of results which make use of algebraic field extensions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The quadratic formula expresses the roots of quadratic polynomials  in terms of algebraic operations on the coefficients plus a square root.
            There are similar
            (but vastly more complicated)
            formulas for solving cubic and quartic (3rd and 4th degree)  polynomial equations,
            which involve algebraic operations and  taking <m>n</m>th roots,
            for different values of <m>n</m>.
            How about quintic (5th degree) polynomials?
            Amazingly, it is possible to prove that there is no general formula for the solution of a quintic equation in terms of roots and algebraic operations.
            Not just the formula is not known<ndash/>there is <em>no formula</em>.
            Period.
            This stupendous result is associated with the mathematicians Evariste Galois, Niels Henrik Abel,
            and Paolo Ruffini, and was proved in the mid-19th century.
            This result relates to field extensions because every solution to an equation that involves only roots and algebraic operations must belong to certain type of field extension of the rationals.
            This fact imposes conditions on the type of numbers that can be expressed in such a form.
            It can be shown that there are roots of 5th-degree equations that don't meet these conditions<mdash/>hence they can't possibly satisfy such an equation.

            Beginning with the Greeks,
            mathematicians tried for thousands of years to find a way to trisect an angle,
            using only straightedge and compass.
            In 1837, Pierre Wantzel finally showed that it is <em>impossible</em>.
            His proof built on previous results of Galois. (Think of how many hours over how many centuries were spent on a futile quest!) This result relates to field extensions in similar fashion as the previous one.
            Geometrical points in the plane are identified as complex numbers
            (as we described in <xref ref="sec_ComplexNumbers_ComplexRoots">Section</xref>).
            Every point constructed based on a set of points is an algebraic combination of the corresponding complex numbers,
            together with square roots.
            This means that every constructable point must be contained in a series of field extensions created by successively adding square roots to an existing field.
            It can be shown that trisecting an angle involves finding a cube root which cannot possibly belong to such a series of extensions.
            You may consult: {\url{https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/a-geometric-proof-of-the-}} {\url{impossibility-of-angle-trisection-by-straightedge-and-compass/}} to get a flavor of how this proof goes.

            A similar constructability problem is known as
            <q>squaring the circle</q>: Given a square of side 1, find a circle with the same area using only straightedge and compass.
            This can be shown to be impossible,
            as a consequence of the transcendence of <m>\pi</m> alluded to in <xref ref="remark_Polynomials_transcendental">Remark</xref>.
