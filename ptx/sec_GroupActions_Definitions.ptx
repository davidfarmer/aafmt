    We'll get to definitions momentarily,
    but first it's helpful to look at an example.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="example_GroupActions_Actions1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the group <m>S_3=\{id,(AB),(AC),(BC),(ABC),(ABC)\}</m> and the set <m>X=\{A,B,C\}</m>.
        Each element of <m>S_3</m>
        <q>does something</q>
        to each element of <m>X</m>.
        See the <xref ref="fig_S3onABC">Figure</xref> below.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig_S3onABC">
        <caption><m>S_3</m> acting on <m>X=\{A,B,C\}</m>.</caption>
        <image width="75%" source="images/S3onABC.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Let's discuss the last element of <m>S_3</m>, <m>(ACB)</m>.
        Notice <m>(ACB)</m>
        <q>does something</q>
        to each element of <m>X</m>.
        It maps <m>A\rightarrow C</m>, <m>B\rightarrow A</m>,
        and <m>C\rightarrow B</m>, so the map images are also elements of <m>X</m>.
        The same is true for all other elements of <m>S_3</m>.
        In fact, each element of <m>S_3</m> produces a bijection on the set <m>X=\{A,B,C\}</m>.
        We refer to this as the group <m>S_3</m>
        <em>acting on</em> the set <m>X</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example xml:id="example_GroupActions_Actions2">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be the group of all rotations around the origin in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.
        Let <m>r_d\in R</m> denote a counterclockwise rotation of <m>d</m> degrees.
        Also, let <m>X</m> be the set of all lines through the origin,
        where <m>x_d</m> denote the line which makes an angle of <m>d</m> degrees with the <m>x</m>-axis.
        See <xref ref="fig_rotate_line">Figure</xref> below.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig_rotate_line">
        <caption><m>r_d=r_{30}</m> acting on the line <m>x_d=x_{15}</m></caption>
        <image width="46%" source="images/rotate_line.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Note that both <m>R</m> and <m>X</m> are infinite sets
        (unlike the previous example).
        As in <xref ref="example_GroupActions_Actions1">Example</xref>,
        each element of <m>R</m>
        <q>does something</q>
        to each element of <m>X</m>.
        In this case,
        each element of <m>R</m> rotates an element of <m>X</m>,
        producing another element of <m>X</m>.
        For example,
        rotating the line <m>x_{15}</m> by <m>r_{30}</m> produces the line <m>x_{45}</m>.
        Furthermore <m>r_{30}</m> can rotate every element of <m>X</m> and <em>only</em>
        produces elements of <m>X</m>.
        This is true for all other rotations in <m>R</m>:
        each element of <m>R</m> produces a bijection on the set <m>X</m>.
        We again say that the group <m>R</m>
        <em>acts on</em> the set <m>X</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    In the previous two examples we have been talking about a group
    <q>action</q>
    which is <em>different</em> from the group operation.
    For example,
    the group operation in <xref ref="example_GroupActions_Actions1">Example</xref>
    is composition of permutations,
    but the action is a mapping of points in <m>\{A,B,C\}</m>.
    In <xref ref="example_GroupActions_Actions2">Example</xref>
    the group operation is composition of rotations,
    but the action is a mapping of lines.
    In order to distinguish the two operations,
    we will use the period (.) to represent group action.
    For example the rotation illustrated in <xref ref="fig_rotate_line">Figure</xref>
    can be expressed mathematically as <m>r_{30}.x_{15}=x_{45}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we have two different operations
    (the group operation and the group action),
    we should determine how they interact with each other.
    We know that two group elements,
    <m>g_1</m> and <m>g_2</m>,
    can produce a third group element via the group operator because of closure,
    and that group element can act on a set element, <m>x</m>.
    We would represent this symbolically as <m>(g_1g_2).x</m>.
    But could that process be done differently?
    Yes, in fact one group element,
    <m>g_2</m>, could act on the set element, <m>x</m>,
    then that resulting set element could be acted on by a different group element,
    <m>g_1</m>.
    Symbolically we would write this as <m>g_1.(g_2.x)</m>.
    It turns out
    (and we will verify)
    that these two processes are equal to each other:
    <m>(g_1g_2).x=g_1.(g_2.x)</m>.
    We refer to this equality as <term>compatibility</term>.
        <idx><h>Actions</h><h>compatibility property of</h></idx>
  </p>
  <example xml:id="example_GroupActions_Compat1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        To investigate this idea of compatibility let's compare
        <m>[(AB)(ACB)].C</m> and <m>(AB).[(ACB).C]</m> where
        <m>(AB),(ACB) \in S_3</m> and <m>B \in X=\{A,B,C\}</m>.
        Note: square brackets were used to group because permutations use parentheses.
        <xref ref="fig_Compatibility1">Figure</xref>
        below has the work and a visual representation of the work.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig_Compatibility1">
        <caption>Formulas and diagrams demonstrating <m>[(AB)(ACB)].C=(AB).[(ACB).C]</m></caption>
        <image width="89%" source="images/Compatibility1.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        So, <m>[(AB)(ACB)].C=A=(AB).[(ACB).C]</m>,
        therefore, we can see compatibility in this specific case.
        Compatibility can be easily shown to hold for the other elements of <m>X</m> because <m>S_3</m> produces a bijection on <m>X</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note the visual difference in the two operations.
        The group operation of composition of permutations has all the mapping arrows for all elements
        (the top left two illustrations).
        This is because the result of a composition of permutations is another permutation.
        The other illustrations have only one mapping arrow because <m>S_3</m> is acting on <m>X</m> producing only a single element of <m>X</m>.

        We will use the period to represent group action.

          Notice that the second condition in <xref ref="definition_GroupActions_defaction">Definition</xref> is NOT associativity.
          It is not associativity because the group operation between <m>g_1</m> and <m>g_2</m> is not the action between <m>g</m> and <m>x</m>.

    Moving forward in this chapter we'll focus just on left group actions.
        <idx><h>Actions</h><h>left and right</h></idx>
    Following are some more examples of group actions.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="example_GroupActions_Action3">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider <m>GL_2(\mathbb{R})</m>
        (the group of invertible <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices)
        and <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.
        Show that <m>GL_2(\mathbb{R})</m> acts on
        <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> by left multiplication on vectors which means that
        <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> is a <m>GL_2(\mathbb{R})</m>-set.
        To check we must show identity and compatibility:
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
              Check identity: If <m>v\in \mathbb{R}^2</m> and <m>I</m> is the identity matrix,
              then <m>I.v = v</m>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Check compatibility: If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <m>2 \times 2</m> invertible matrices,
