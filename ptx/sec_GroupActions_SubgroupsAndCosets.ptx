  <title>Group actions associated with subgroups and cosets</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      It turns out that if the set <m>X</m> is also a group,
      then it's always possible to define a group action of <m>X</m> on itself,
      where the group action is identical to the group operation:
      <m>g.x:=gx</m>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_GroupActions_SubgroupAction1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the group <m>\mathbb{Z}_5</m> which as we know is a group under addition.
          We will show that <m>\mathbb{Z}_5</m> is a
          <m>\mathbb{Z}_5</m>-set where the group action is <m>g.x := g+x</m>.
          To do this we must show the identity and compatibility conditions.
          First, <m>0.x = 0+x = x</m> for all <m>x \in\mathbb {Z}_5</m>,
          so the identity condition is met.
          Secondly, we need to show compatibility:
          by the associative property of addition in <m>\mathbb {Z}_5</m>,
          we have <m>(g_1+g_2).x = (g_1+g_2)+x = g_1+(g_2+x) = g_1.(g_2.x)</m> for all <m>x,
          g_1,g_2 \in\mathbb{ Z}_5</m>.
          So the compatibility condition is met.
          Therefore, by definition of <m>G</m>-set,
          <m>\mathbb{Z}_5</m> is a <m>\mathbb{Z}_5</m>-set.

      Recall our discussion of cosets in <xref ref="Cosets">Chapter</xref> In particular,
      a left coset consists of a group element <m>g</m> acting on a subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m>.
      The group element acts on each element of the subgroup to create a coset.
      In other words,
      a coset is a subgroup shifted by action of a group element.
      If <m>G</m> is a group, we can let <m>L</m> be the set of left cosets.
      We will see in the following examples that we can define a group action on <m>L</m>.
      That is the set of left cosets,
      <m>L</m> is a <m>G</m>-set.
      Let <m>G</m> be the additive group of real numbers.
      That is, <m>G=(\mathbb{R},+)</m>,
      and let <m>H</m> be all integer multiples of <m>2\pi</m>.
      That is, <m>H=\{2k\pi:k\in \mathbb{Z}\}</m>,
      or <m>H = 2 \pi \mathbb{Z}</m> for short.

        <p>
          Let <m>L</m> be the set of left cosets of
          <m>2\pi \mathbb{Z}</m> in the group <m>(\mathbb{R},+)</m>.
          Recall from <xref ref="definition_Cosets_def_coset">Definition</xref>
          in <xref ref="Cosets">Chapter</xref>
          that the set of left cosets <m>L</m> is defined as <m>x+2\pi \mathbb{Z}=\{x+h:h\in 2\pi\mathbb{Z}\}</m>.
          For example,
          the left coset which contains <m>\pi/3</m> is the set <m>\{\pi/3 +2k\pi,
          k\in \mathbb{Z}\}</m>,
          which we could also write as <m>\{ \ldots \pi/3-4\pi, \pi/3-2\pi, \pi/3, \pi/3+2\pi, \pi/3 + 4\pi, \ldots \}</m>.
          It turns out that <m>L</m> is <m>G</m>-set under the action <m>(g,x+2\pi\mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow g+x+2\pi\mathbb{Z}</m>.
          Let's verify the two conditions of a <m>G</m>-set:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <p>
                For the identity condition note that <m>e\in G=0</m>.
                Then, <m>0+x+2\pi\mathbb{Z}=x+2\pi\mathbb{Z}</m> for any <m>x+2\pi\mathbb{Z}\in L</m>.
                So the identity condition is true.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                For the compatibility condition consider two real numbers <m>a,b</m>.
                Then, by associativity of real number addition,
                <m>(a+b)+x+2\pi\mathbb{Z}=a+(b+x+2\pi\mathbb{Z})</m> for any <m>x+2\pi\mathbb{Z}</m> in <m>L</m>.
                So the compatibility condition is true.
                <m>L</m> is a <m>G</m>-set of the additive group of real numbers.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          This example has a very practical significance.
          We know that angles on a unit circle are arbitrary up to multiples of <m>2\pi</m>.
          So we can think of each angle as a coset:
          that is, the angle <m>\theta</m> where
          <m>0\leq\theta\lt 2\pi</m> corresponds to the coset <m>\theta + 2\pi \mathbb{Z}</m>,
          which represents the set of values <m>\{\theta +2k\pi\}</m>,
          where <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
          Now consider what an arbitrary rotation <m>\phi</m> does to the angle <m>\theta</m>.
          For instance, consider the case where
          <m>\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}</m><nbsp/><ndash/><nbsp/>then <m>\theta+H=\{ \frac{\pi}{4}+2k\pi\}</m>.
          We'll suppose that the rotation angle is <m>\phi=\frac{15\pi}{2}</m>.
          According to the group action,
          <m>\phi+\theta+H =\frac{15\pi}{2}+\{\frac{\pi}{4}+2k\pi\}</m> which will result in the new coset <m>\{\frac{31\pi}{4}+2k\pi\}=\{\frac{7\pi}{4}+2k\pi\}</m>.
          As we can see,
          the action of the additive group <m>(R,+)</m> on the cosets
          <m>\theta + 2\pi \mathbb{Z}</m> corresponds to rotation by arbitrary angles around the unit circle.
          If the rotation is more than <m>2 \pi</m>,
          the action still works because the cosets take care of any extra factors of <m>2 \pi</m>.
        </p>

      In the following exercise you will generalize the above example by showing how the set of all left cosets from a particular subgroup of group <m>G</m> is a <m>G</m>-set.

      In this section we'll take a close look at a group action on a set of cosets.
      This example can be thought of as a two-dimensional version of <xref ref="example_GroupActions_AngleCoset2">Example</xref>,

      where <m>a :=(x,y)</m> can be any element of <m>G</m>.
      Recall from <xref ref="proposition_Cosets_cosets_theorem_2">Proposition</xref> that cosets form a partition,

      The floor function takes a real number,

      We will use these brackets,

      it follows that <m>b+a+H =(0.5, 0.8)+H</m>.
      Recall that by definition a left coset of the integer lattice <m>a+H</m> means adding the same point,
      <m>a=(x,y)</m>, to each point in the integer lattice, <m>H</m>.
      A group action simply changes one coset of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> to a different coset.
      The top illustration in <xref ref="fig_IntegerLattice1">Figure</xref>
      show the displacement of the coset <m>a+H</m> when acted on by <m>b</m> on the left from <xref ref="example_GroupActions_IntLat1">Example</xref>.

      Our above discussion can help us describe the motion of a character on the screen of a
      <q>wraparound</q>
      video game.
      Imagine the unit square is your TV or computer screen.
      Suppose the character starts near the right edge at the point <m>a=(0.7,0.5)</m>,
      and undergoes linear motion to the right and up in the direction of the displacement vector <m>b=(0.8,0.3)</m>.
      Then he moves off the right edge of the screen and re-appears instantly at the left edge,
      ending up at the previously found point
      <m>c=(0.5,0.8)</m> as shown in <xref ref="fig_wraparound1">Figure</xref>.
      So the point <m>b+a+h=c</m> where <m>h=(-1,0)</m>.

      In our conclusion of <xref ref="exercise_GroupActions_IntLatBijection">Exercise</xref>,
      we found that there's a bijection between the points of the unit square and the cosets of <m>H</m>.
      So instead of observing an entire coset,
      we only need to look at the point that is currently inside the unit square,
      as seen in <xref ref="fig_wraparound1">Figure</xref> for example.
      What appears to be a jumpy motion in the unit square (i.e. when the point jumps from the right edge to the left edge) can also be understood in terms of a continuous
      <q>motion</q>
      of cosets.

          Consider group elements <m>a=(-0.6,-0.4)</m> and
          <m>b=(0.9,1.6)</m> where <m>a,b \in \mathbb{R}^2</m>.
          Let's first find the point
          <m>h=(m,n) \in H</m> such that <m>b+a+H</m> is inside the unit square.
          From <xref ref="exercise_GroupActions_floorh">Exercise</xref>,
          <m>m=-\lfloor -0.6+0.9 \rfloor=-\lfloor 0.3 \rfloor=0</m> and <m>n=-\lfloor -0.4+1.6 \rfloor=-\lfloor 1.2 \rfloor=-1</m>,
          so <m>h=(0,-1)</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, let's find the point <m>b+a+h</m> in the unit square,
          let's call this point <m>c</m>.
          <me>
            c=(0.9,1.6)+(-0.6,-0.4)+(0,-1)=(0.3,0.2)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          So <m>c=(0.3,0.2)</m> and is a point inside the unit square.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, let's graph the
          <q>movement</q>
          of the points that are visible to only the unit square throughout the group action <m>b</m> on <m>a+H</m>.

          which follow the action of <m>b</m> on <m>a+H</m>.
          Note that each path is a continuous straight segment.
          However, if we restrict our field of view to the unit square (see <xref ref="fig_Lattice2">Figure</xref> (bottom)),
          there appears to be four disconnected segments,
          but the top figure shows us how these can be envisioned as a continuous motion.

      We can think about this example in another way.
      Suppose we have a <em>torus</em>,
      which is the mathematical word for a donut shape.
      We could imagine creating a
      <q>map</q>
      of the surface of the torus by cutting the torus apart as shown in <xref ref="fig_Torus1">Figure</xref>.
      If we spread this map out flat,
      it would look like a square
      (see <xref ref="fig_Torus2">Figure</xref>).
      If we wanted to use the map to chart motion on the surface of the torus,
      then any motion that goes off the right edge would reappear at the left edge;
      and any motion that goes off the top edge would reappear at the bottom.
      So you see this is exactly what we saw for the previous example.
      So using cosets of <m>\mathbb{Z}^2</m> in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>,
      we've created a mathematical representation for motion on the surface of a torus.

      We can generalize the two previous examples by considering cosets of a subgroup <m>H</m> in a group <m>G</m> that contains <m>H</m>.

    <example xml:id="example_GroupActions_CosetAction">

        <p>
          Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> and <m>L_H</m> the set of left cosets of <m>H</m>.
          The set <m>L_H</m> is a <m>G</m>-set under the action
          <m>g.(xH)=(gx)H</m> (note that <m>gx\in G</m> so <m>(gx)H</m> is a coset of <m>H</m>).
          Again, it is easy to see that the identity condition is true.
          Since <m>(gg').(xH) =(gg'x)H=g.((g'x)H)= g.(g'.(xH))</m>,
          the compatibility condition is also true.

      So far, we've been looking at group actions on left cosets.
      What about right cosets?
      Let's investigate.

    <exercise xml:id="exercise_GroupActions_RtCosetAction">

          <m>H=\{\var{id},(12)\}</m>,
          and <m>R</m> is the set of right cosets of <m>H</m>.
          Define a function from <m>G\times R\rightarrow R</m> by <m>(g,R)\rightarrow Rg</m>.

      The previous exercise shows that we can't always do the same thing with right cosets that we can do with left cosets.
