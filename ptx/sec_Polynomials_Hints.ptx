    <xref ref="exercise_Polynomials_multform">Exercise</xref>(d): Are there any common factors you can take outside the summations before multiplying?

    <xref ref="exercise_Polynomials_5Z">Exercise</xref>: Note that if <m>a_2</m> is in <m>5\mathbb{Z}</m>,
    then <m>a_2 = 5a_2^{\prime}</m> where <m>a_2^{\prime}</m> is also an integer.
    The same thing holds for al the other coefficients in <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.
