    Switchyards are used by railroads to rearrange the order of train cars in a train
    (see <xref ref="fig_grandview">Figure</xref>).
    In this section we will study a
    <q>switchyard</q>
    of sorts.
    The design of our mathematical
    <q>switchyard</q>
    is not realistic,
    but the example will help us understand some important fundamental properties of permutations.

    <xref ref="fig_switchyard">Figure</xref>
    shows how the switchyard works.
    The figure shows the particular case of a switchyard with 12 positions.
    A railroad train with 12 cars pulls in from the right,
    and circles around until it fills the circular track.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_switchyard">

  <p>
    The positions (we'll call them <em>slots</em>
    for short) are numbered 1 through 12 as are the railroad cars.
    At the <em>starting position</em>,
    each railroad car is at the corresponding numbered slot:
    car 1 is in slot 1, <m>\ldots</m> car 12 is in slot 12.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the starting position, the train can move in one of two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The train can move circularly around the track,
          so that car 1 can end up at any one of the 12 slots.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Alternatively, the cars in slots 1 and 2 can switch places.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    These two types of motions can be represented as permutations.
    In tableau notation,
    the first row of the tableau corresponds to the train car,
    while the second row corresponds to the slot it moves to.
    For example, if the train cars
    <m>1,2,3, \ldots ,11, 12</m> move counterclockwise one slot to occupy slots
    <m>2,3,4,\ldots ,12,1</m> respectively, then the permutation
    (in tableau notation)
    is:
    <me>
      \left( \begin{array}{cccccccccccc} 1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \amp  4 \amp  5 \amp  6 \amp  7 \amp  8 \amp  9 \amp  10 \amp  11 \amp  12 \\ 2 \amp  3 \amp  4 \amp  5 \amp  6 \amp  7 \amp  8 \amp  9 \amp  10 \amp  11 \amp  12 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    In cycle notation,
    the same permutation would be <m>(1 \; 2 \; 3 \; 4 \; \ldots \; 12)</m>.
    We will denote this permutation by <m>r</m>.
    On the other hand, if cars 1 and 2 are switched,
    then this corresponds to the permutation <m>(1 2)</m>.
    We will denote this permutation by <m>t</m>.
    In summary:
    <me>
      r = (1 \; 2 \; \ldots \; 12);\qquad  t = (1 \, 2)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's look at some other motions of the train.
    Suppose for example we shift the train counterclockwise by two positions.
    This corresponds to performing the permutation <m>r</m> twice in succession,
    which is <m>r \compose r</m> or <m>r^2</m>.
    If we think about the process of composition,
    what's going on is the first <m>r</m> moves car 1
    (which occupies slot 1)
    to slot 2;
    while the second <m>r</m> moves whatever's in slot 2
    (which happens to be car 1)
    to slot 3.
    The resulting composition can be interpreted as showing where each of the cars end up after both moves.
    The same thing will be true if we compose any number of permutations.
  </p>
  <p>
    It follows that all rearrangements of the cars that can be accomplished by the switchyard may be obtained as compositions of the permutations <m>r</m> and <m>t</m>.
    So what rearrangements are possible?
    I'm glad you asked that question!
    The following exercises are designed to help you figure this out.
    But first, let's consider one type of rearrangement that's particularly important.
    Suppose we want to switch two consecutive cars that are not 1 and 2:
    say for example we want to switch cars 5 and 6, and leave the rest of the cars unchanged.
    Can we do this?
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point,
    in order to follow along the reader may find it helpful to make his/her own model of a switchyard.<fn>
    The models in this section
    (and photos)
    were made by Holly Webb.
    </fn> <xref ref="fig_switchyardHome">Figure</xref>
    shows a simple model made out of a jar lid with numbers stuck on with putty.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_switchyardHome">
    <caption>
    <q>Switchyard</q>
    model in home position</caption>
    <image width="46%" source="images/switchyardHomeposition.png"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    We'll illustrate the motions necessary to switch cars 5 and 6 using the model.
    First, we rotate cars 5 and 6 to slots 1 and 2 by rotating 4 slots clockwise.
    This permutation is shown in <xref ref="fig_switchyardCl4">Figure</xref>,
    and is written mathematically as <m>r^{-4}</m>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_switchyardCl4">
    <caption>First stage in switching cars 5 and 6: clockwise rotation <m>r^{-4}</m>.</caption>
    <image width="46%" source="images/switchyardCl4.png"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Next, we exchange the two cars
    (which we can do since they're in the first two positions).
    <xref ref="fig_switchyard_t">Figure</xref> shows the switch,
    which is denoted by <m>t</m>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_switchyard_t">
    <caption>Second stage in switching cars 5 and 6: switch <m>t</m>.</caption>
    <image width="46%" source="images/switchyard_t.png"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Finally, all we need to do is rotate counterclockwise 4 slots (<m>r^4</m>),
    as shown in <xref ref="fig_switchyardCCL4">Figure</xref>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_switchyardCCL4">
    <caption>Third stage in switching cars 5 and 6: counterclockwise rotation <m>r^{4}</m>.</caption>
    <image width="46%" source="images/switchyardCCL4.png"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Altogether, these three steps give the composition <m>r^4 \compose t \compose r^{-4}</m>
    (remember that permutations are applied right to left,
    just like functions).
    Note also that in the case of a 12-slot switchyard,
    <m>r^{-4}</m> could also be written <m>r^8</m>,
    since a clockwise rotation of 4 slots is the same as a counterclockwise rotation of 8 slots.
    (If the switchyard has <m>n</m> positions,
    the general rule is that <m>r^{-m} = r^{n-m}</m>,
    as we saw in the Symmetries chapter.)

    What we have shown in the previous exercise is that the two permutations <m>r</m> and <m>t</m>
    <em>generate</em> the group <m>S_n</m>.
    In other words,
    all of the information contained in the huge and complicated group <m>S_n</m> is characterized in just two permutations!
    The study of group generators is an important part of group theory,
    but unfortunately it is beyond the level of this course.
