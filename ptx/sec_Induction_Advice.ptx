  <title>Advice on writing up induction proofs</title>
  <p>
    Here are four things to keep in mind as you write up induction proofs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>#1: Begin any induction proof by stating precisely,
    and prominently,
    the statement you plan to prove.</em>
    This statement typically involves an equation
    (or assertion)
    in the variable <m>n</m>, and we're trying to prove this equation
    (or assertion)
    for all natural numbers <m>n</m> bigger than a certain value.
    A good idea is to write out the statement and label it as
    <q><m>P(n)</m></q>, so that it's easy to spot, and easy to reference;
    see the sample proofs for examples.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>#2: Be sure to properly begin and end the induction step.</em>
    From a logical point of view,
    an induction step is a proof of a statement of the form,
    <q>for all <m>k\in\NN, P(k)\Rightarrow P(k+1)</m></q>. To prove such a statement, you need to start out by asserting,
    <q>let <m>k\in \NN</m> be given</q>),
    then assume <m>P(k)</m> is true (
    <q>Suppose <m>P(n)</m> is true for <m>n=k</m></q>),
    and, after a sequence of logical deductions, derive <m>P(k+1)</m> (
    <q>Therefore <m>P(n)</m> is true for <m>n=k+1</m></q>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>#3: Use different letters for the general variable appearing in the statement you seek to prove (<m>n</m> in the above example) and the variable used for the induction step (<m>k</m> in the above example).</em>
    The reason for this distinction is that in the induction step you want to be able to say something like the following:
    <q>Let <m>k\in\NN</m> be given,
    and suppose <m>P(k)</m> .... [Proof of induction step goes here] ... Therefore <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.</q>
    Without introducing a second variable <m>k</m>,
    such a statement wouldn't make sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>#4: Always clearly state,
    at the appropriate place in the induction step,
    when the induction hypothesis is being used.</em> E.g., say
    <q>By the induction hypthesis we have ...</q>, or use a parenthetical note
    <q>(by induction hypothesis)</q>
    in a chain of equations as in the above example.
    The induction hypothesis is the case <m>n=k</m> of the statement we seek to prove (i.e., the statement
    <q><m>P(k)</m></q>
    and it is what you assume at the start of the induction step.
    The place where this hypothesis is used is the most crucial step in an induction argument,
    and you must get this hypothesis into play at some point during the proof of the induction step<mdash/>if not,
    you are doing something wrong.
