      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the group <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.
          Let us try to find the smallest subgroup of
          <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> that contains the number 1.
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                We start with the smallest subset possible, <m>P = \{ 1 \}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The subset has to be a group under addition.
                But so far <m>P</m> does not contain an additive identity.
                So we need to add <m>0</m> to the set,
                giving us <m>P = \{ 0, 1 \}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Zero is its own inverse under addition,
                but notice that our set does not include an inverse for <m>1</m>.
                So we add <m>-1</m> to <m>P</m>,
                giving us <m>P = \{ -1, 0, 1 \}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Is <m>P</m> closed under addition?
                Certainly when we add <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>,
                we get <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>, respectively.
                And <m>-1 + 1 = 0</m>.
                But what about when we add <m>1</m> and <m>1</m>,
                or <m>-1</m> and <m>-1</m>?
                So we need to add <m>2</m> and <m>-2</m> to the set,
                giving us <m>P = \{ -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 \}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now, what about <m>1 + 2</m>, or <m>(-1) + (-2)</m>?
                So we need <m>3</m> and <m>-3</m>,
                giving us <m>P = \{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                And we can see that this process would keep going until we get all the integers.
                In other words,
                <m>P = \{ \ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \} = {\mathbb Z}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the smallest subgroup of
          <m>\mathbb Z</m> that contains <m>1</m> is <m>\mathbb Z</m> itself.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      From the last example,
      we saw that <m>P</m> was generated through repeated additions of <m>1</m> and repeated additions of <m>-1</m>
      (with <m>0</m> thrown in for good measure).
      Zero in fact can be calculated by adding <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>,
      and can be thought of as a zero multiple of <m>1</m>.
      In addition,
      the repeated additions of <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m> can be thought of as positive and negative multiples of <m>1</m>.
      Therefore we can think of all the elements of <m>P</m> as integer multiples of <m>1</m>.
      We denote the set of all integer multiples of 1 as <m>\langle 1 \rangle</m>;
      therefore,
      <me>
        \langle 1 \rangle = \{ n \cdot 1 : n \in \mathbb Z \} = P
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="example_Groups_construct_Z">Example</xref>
      we also saw that <m>P</m> was in fact <m>\mathbb Z</m>;
      therefore <m>\mathbb Z = \langle 1 \rangle</m>.
      We say that <m>\mathbb Z</m> is
      <em>generated by</em> <m>1</m>,
      as per the following definition:
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us extend this concept to groups in general:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {defn_set_gen} Given a group <m>G</m> and an element <m>a \in G</m>,
          then <term>the set generated by the element</term>
          <m>a</m><idx><h>Set</h><h>generated by group element</h></idx> is denoted by <m>\langle a \rangle</m>,
          and is defined as the set obtained by repeated multiplication of the identity <m>e</m> by the group elements <m>a</m> and <m>a^{-1}</m>.
          Using the notation we introduced right before <xref ref="proposition_Groups_exponent_laws">Proposition</xref>,
          we can write this as
          <me>
            \langle a \rangle = \{ \ldots, a^{-3}, a^{-2}, a^{-1}, e, a, a^2, a^3, \ldots \}
          </me>
          or
          <me>
            \langle a \rangle = \{ a^{k} : k \in \mathbb Z \}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\langle a \rangle</m> is sometimes called the
          <term>orbit</term> of <m>a</m>.
              <idx><h>Orbit</h><h>of a group element</h></idx>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <remark xml:id="rem_orbits">
      <p>
        If we are using the
        <q>+</q>
        operation, as in the case of the integers above,
        we write <m>\langle a \rangle = \{ na : n \in {\mathbb Z} \}</m>.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise_Groups_gen_3_Rstar">
      <statement>

      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      We have special terminology for the case where all the elements of a group are generated by a single element:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {cyclic_generator} If a group <m>G</m> contains some element <m>a</m> such that <m>G = \langle a \rangle</m>,
          then <m>G</m> is a <term>cyclic group</term>
              <idx><h>Group</h><h>cyclic</h></idx>.
              <idx><h>Cyclic group</h></idx>
          In this case <m>a</m> is a <term> generator</term><idx><h>Generator</h><h>of a cyclic group</h></idx>
              <idx><h>Cyclic group</h><h>generator</h></idx>
          of <m>G</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We have seen above that <m>1</m> is a generator of <m>\mathbb Z</m>,
      and thus <m>\mathbb Z</m> is a cyclic group.
      A cyclic group may have more than one generator:

          <m>\langle 1 \rangle</m> is computed as follows:

            <li>
              <p>
                Notice that we've already generated all the elements in <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m>.
                So we don't have to worry about finding the additive integer multiples of <m>1^{-1}</m> (Note that <m>(1^{-1} = 5)</m>),
                because these calculations can't produce any new elements.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                So <m>\langle 1 \rangle = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0 \} = {\mathbb Z}_6</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> is a cyclic group generated by <m>1</m>.

    <p>
      We've just seen that <m>1</m> is a generator of <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m>,
      but that doesn't mean it's the <em>only</em> generator.

        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>a</m> be any element in <m>G</m>.
          Then the set
          <men xml:id="generatedby">
            \langle a \rangle  = \{ a^k : k \in {\mathbb Z} \}

          is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
          Furthermore,
          any subgroup of <m>G</m> which contains <m>a</m> must also contain <m>\langle a \rangle</m>.

      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The identity is in <m>\langle a \rangle</m> since <m>a^0 = e</m>.
        If <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> are any two elements in <m>\langle a \rangle</m>,
        then by the definition of <m>\langle a \rangle</m> we can write <m>g = a^m</m> and <m>h = a^n</m> for some integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>.
        So <m>gh = a^m a^n = a^{m+n}</m> is again in <m>\langle a \rangle</m>.
        Finally, if <m>g = a^n</m> in <m>\langle a \rangle</m>,
        then the inverse <m>g^{-1} = a^{-n}</m> is also in <m>\langle a \rangle</m>.
        Clearly, any subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> containing <m>a</m> must contain all the powers of <m>a</m> by closure;
        hence, <m>H</m> contains <m>\langle a \rangle</m>.

      Let us now consider in particular the case of finite groups.
      Let <m>G</m> be a finite group,
      and let <m>a</m> be an element of <m>G</m>.
      Consider the set <m>A :=\left\{a, a^2, a^3, \ldots \right\}</m>.
      Since <m>A \subset G</m> and <m>G</m> is finite,
      the set <m>A</m> must also be finite.
      In particular,
      the list <m>\left\{a, a^2, a^3, \ldots\right\}</m> must contain duplicate elements,
      since otherwise <m>A</m> would be infinite.
      We must therefore have <m>a^k = a^l</m> for two different natural numbers <m>k,l</m>.

      How about the converse of <xref ref="proposition_Groups_cyclic_abelian">Proposition</xref>?
      Is it true that every abelian group is cyclic?
      As it turns out, No.
      The following proposition gives an example:

    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Groups_realNotCyclic">
      <statement>

          The group <m>({\mathbb R},+)</m> is not cyclic.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We'll use our old workhorse, proof by contradiction.
        Suppose that <m>a</m> is a generator of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>, i.e.
        <m>\langle a \rangle = \mathbb{R}</m>.
        Then since <m>a/2 \in \mathbb{R}</m>,
        it follows that <m>a/2 \in \langle a \rangle</m>.
        This means <m>a/2 =ka</m> for some integer k.
        Rearranging this equation, we find that <m>a(1/2-k)=0</m>.
        By the zero-divisor property of real numbers,
        this implies that either <m>a=0</m> or <m>1/2-k = 0</m>
        (or both).
        But <m>a</m> cannot be 0, because <m>\langle 0 \rangle = 0</m>.
        Also, <m>1/2-k \neq 0</m>, since <m>k</m> is an integer.
        This contradiction shows that our assumption that <m>{\mathbb R} = \langle a \rangle</m> is false.
        Therefore <m>{\mathbb R} \neq \langle a \rangle</m> for any real number <m>a</m>,
        and <m>{\mathbb R}</m> is not cyclic.

    <title>Subgroups of cyclic groups</title>
    <p>
      We can ask some interesting questions about cyclic subgroups of a group and subgroups of a cyclic group.
      If <m>G</m> is a group, which subgroups of <m>G</m> are cyclic?
      If <m>G</m> is a cyclic group,
      what type of subgroups does <m>G</m> possess?
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The main tools used in this proof are the division algorithm,
        which we mentioned in <xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmetic_DivAlg">Proposition</xref>,
        and the Principle of Well-Ordering,
        which we mentioned in <xref ref="subsec_Preliminaries_OrderRelations">Section</xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a cyclic group generated by <m>a</m> and suppose that <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
        If <m>H = \{ e \}</m>, then trivially <m>H</m> is cyclic.
        Suppose that <m>H</m> contains some other element <m>g</m> distinct from the identity.
        Then <m>g</m> can be written as <m>a^n</m> for some integer <m>n</m>.
        We can assume that <m>n > 0</m>.
        Define the set <m>S</m> by:
        <m>S = \{j \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } a^j=g\}</m>.
        We have just shown that <m>S</m> is nonempty.
        The Principle of Well-Ordering tells us that any nonempty subset of the natural numbers has a smallest element.
        Let <m>m</m> be the smallest element of <m>S</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We claim that <m>h = a^m</m> is a generator for <m>H</m>.
        We must show that every <m>h' \in H</m> can be written as a power of <m>h</m>.
        Since <m>h' \in H</m> and <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
        <m>h' = a^k</m> for some positive integer <m>k</m>.
        Using the division algorithm,
        we can find numbers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that
        <m>k = mq +r</m> where <m>0 \leq r \lt  m</m>; hence,
        <me>
          a^k = a^{mq +r} = (a^m)^q a^r = h^q a^r
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we can solve for <m>a^r</m>:
        <m>a^r =h^{-q}  a^k</m>.
        Since <m>a^k</m> and <m>h^{-q}</m> are in <m>H</m>,
        <m>a^r</m> must also be in <m>H</m>.
        However, <m>m</m> was the smallest positive number such that <m>a^m</m> was in <m>H</m>;
        consequently, <m>r=0</m> and so <m>k=mq</m>.
        Therefore,
        <me>
          h' = a^k = a^{mq} =  h^q
        </me>
        and <m>H</m> is generated by <m>h</m>.

          Let <m>G</m> be a cyclic group of order <m>n</m> and suppose that <m>a</m> is a generator for <m>G</m>.

    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>G=\langle a \rangle</m> it follows from <xref ref="proposition_Groups_OrderEltCyclic">Proposition</xref> that <m>|a|=n</m>.
        In <xref ref="exercise_Groups_OrderEltCyclic">Exercise</xref>
        (a) we proved that <m>a^k = a^{\bmod(m,n)}</m>.
        Let <m>r =\bmod(m,n)</m>.
        If <m>r=0</m>
        (which is the same thing as saying that <m>n</m> divides <m>k</m>)
        this implies <m>a^k = a^{0} = e</m>.
        Otherwise, if it must be the case that <m>0\lt r\lt n=|a|</m>,
        and by the definition of <m>|a|</m> it follows that <m>a^r \neq e</m>.
        This concludes the proof.

        We wish to find the smallest integer <m>m</m> such that <m>e = b^m = a^{km}</m>.
        By <xref ref="proposition_Groups_Cyclic_subgrp_order">Proposition</xref>,
        this is the smallest integer <m>m</m> such that <m>n</m> divides <m>km</m> or,
        equivalently,
        <m>n/d</m> divides <m>m(k/d)</m>.
        (Note that <m>n/d</m> and <m>k/d</m> are both integers,
        since <m>d</m> divides both <m>n</m> and <m>k</m>.)
        Since <m>d</m> is the greatest common divisor of <m>n</m> and <m>k</m>,
        <m>n/d</m> and <m>k/d</m> are relatively prime.
        Hence, for <m>n/d</m> to divide <m>m(k/d)</m> it must divide <m>m</m>.
        The smallest such <m>m</m> is <m>n/d</m>.
