        <em>Recurrences:</em> The first  few problems deal with properties of the Fibonacci sequence and related recurrence sequences.
        The Fibonacci sequence is defined by <m>F_1=1</m>,
        <m>F_2=1</m>, and <m>F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}</m> for <m>n\ge 3</m>.
        Its first few terms are <m>1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,\dots</m>.
        In the following problems, use an appropriate form of induction
        (standard induction or strong induction)
        to establish the desired properties and formulas.
        (Note that some of these problems require only ordinary induction.)
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Fibonacci sums:</em> Prove that
              <m>\sum_{i=1}^n F_i=F_{n+2}-1</m> for all <m>n\in\NN</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Fibonacci matrix:</em>  Show that, for all <m>n\in\NN</m>,
              <me>
                \tag{\(P(n)\)} \mat 1110^n =\mat {F_{n+1}}{F_n} {F_n}{F_{n-1}}
              </me>.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Odd/even Fibonacci numbers:</em>
              Prove that the Fibonacci numbers follow the pattern odd,odd,even:
              that is, show that for any positive integer <m>m</m>,
              <m>F_{3m-2}</m> and <m>F_{3m-1}</m> are odd and <m>F_{3m}</m> is even.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Inequalities for recurrence sequences:</em>
              Let the sequence <m>T_n</m> (
              <q>Tribonacci sequence</q>
              ) be defined by <m>T_1=T_2=T_3=1</m> and <m>T_n=T_{n-1}+T_{n-2}+T_{n-3}</m> for <m>n\ge4</m>.
              Prove that
              <me>
                T_n\lt 2^n \tag{\(P(n)\)}
              </me>
              holds for all <m>n\in\NN</m>.
              We'll give an outline for the proof of (d).
              We will prove <m>P(n)</m> by strong induction.
              <em>Base step:</em> For <m>n=1,2,3</m>,
              <m>T_n</m> is equal to <em><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/></em>,
              whereas the right-hand side of <m>P(n)</m> is equal to <m>2^1=2</m>,
              <m>2^2=4</m>,
              and <m>2^3=8</m>, respectively.
              Thus, <m>P(n)</m> holds for <m>n=1,2,3</m>.
              <em>Induction step:</em> Let <m>k\ge3</m> be given and suppose <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n=1,2,\dots,k</m>.
              Then
              <md>
                <mrow>T_{k+1}\amp =T_{k}+T_{k-1}+\underline{~~~~} \text{ (by recurrence for \(T_n\)) }</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp \lt 2^{k}+2^{k-1}+\underline{~~~~}  \text{ (strong ind. hyp. \\amp  (\(P(k), P(k-1),P(k-2)\)) }</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp =2^{k+1}\left(\frac12+\frac14+\underline{~~~~}\right)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp =2^{k+1}\cdot \underline{~~~~} \lt 2^{k+1}</mrow>
              </md>.
              Thus, <em><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/></em> holds,
              and the proof of the induction step is complete.
              <em>Conclusion:</em> By the strong induction principle,
              it follows that <m>P(n)</m>  is true for all <m>n\in\NN</m>.

        <em>Representation problems.</em>
        One of the main applications of strong induction is to prove the existence of representations of integers of various types.
        In these applications,
        strong induction is usually needed in its full force,
        i.e., in the induction step,
        one needs to assume that all predecessor cases <m>n=1,2,\dots,k</m>.

              <em>The postage stamp problem:</em>
              Determine which postage amounts can be created using the stamps of <m>3</m> and <m>7</m> cents.
              In other words,
              determine the exact set of positive integers <m>n</m> that can be written in the form <m>n=3x+7y</m> with <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> nonnegative integers.
              (<em>Hint</em>: Check the first few values of <m>n</m> directly,
              then use strong induction to show that,
              from a certain point <m>n_0</m> onwards,
              all numbers <m>n</m> have such a representation.)

              <em>Binary representation:</em>
              Using strong induction prove that every positive integer <m>n</m> can be represented as a sum of
              <em>distinct</em> powers of <m>2</m>,
              i.e., in the form <m>n=2^{i_1}+\dots + 2^{i_h}</m> with integers
              <m>0\le i_1\lt \dots \lt i_h</m>. (<em>Hint</em>: To ensure distinctness,
              use the <em>largest</em> power of <m>2</m> as the first
              <q>building block</q>
              in the induction step. )

              <em>Factorial representation.</em>
              Show that any integer <m>n\ge1</m> has a represention in the form <m>n=d_11!+d_22!+\cdots+d_rr!</m> with
              <q>digits</q>
              <m>d_i</m> in the range <m>d_i\in\{0,1,\dots,i\}</m>. (<em>Hint</em>: Use again the
              <q>greedy</q>
              trick (pick the largest factorial that
              <q>fits</q>
              as your first building block), and use the fact
              (established in an earlier problem)
              that <m>\sum_{i=1}^ki!i=(k+1)!-1</m>.)
