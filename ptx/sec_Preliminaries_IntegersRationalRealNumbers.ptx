    <p>
      We assume that you have already been introduced to the following number systems:
      integers, rational numbers, and real numbers.
      These number systems possess the well-known arithmetic operations of addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, and division.
      The following statements hold for all of these number systems.
    </p>
    <warning>
      <p>
        There are number systems for which the following properties do NOT hold
        (as we shall see later).
        So they may be safely assumed ONLY for integers,
        rational numbers, and real numbers.

      Note that the associative property allows us to write expressions without putting in so many parentheses.
      So instead of writing <m>(a+b)+c</m>,
      we may simply write <m>a+b+c</m>.
      By the same reasoning,
      we can remove parentheses from any expression that involves only addition,
      or any expression that involves only multiplication:
      so for instance,
      <m>(a \cdot (b \cdot c) \cdot d) \cdot e = a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d \cdot e</m>.
      Using the associative and distributive property,
      it is possible to write any arithmetic expression without parentheses.
      So for example,
      <m>(a \cdot b) \cdot (c + d)</m> can be written as <m>a \cdot b \cdot c + a \cdot b \cdot d</m>.
      (Remember that according to operator precedence rules,
      multiplication is always performed before addition:
      thus <m>3 \cdot 4 + 2</m> is evaluated by first taking <m>3 \cdot 4</m> and then adding 2.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There properties can be used to prove arithmetic statements that ordinarily we take for granted.
      For example,
      we automatically replace <m>-1 \cdot a</m> with <m>-a</m>,
      but this really needs to be justified.
      In fact, this requires one of the other properties in the above list:
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>a + (-1 \cdot a) = 0 and (-1 \cdot a)=0</m>
          (this is the same thing as showing that
          <m>-1 \cdot a</m> is the additive inverse of <m>a</m>,
          or <m>-1 \cdot a = -a</m>).
          Which of the above properties did you use?

      As a result of the previous exercise,
      we have a proof of the following proposition:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Preliminaries_minusOne">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any integer, rational,
          or real number <m>a</m> the following equation holds:
          <m>-a = (-1) \cdot a</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      This proposition may seem way too obvious to you,
      but it's actually saying something very significant.
      <q><m>-a</m></q>
      denotes the additive inverse of <m>a</m>, while
      <q><m>(-1) \cdot a</m></q>
      denotes the additive inverse of 1 times the number <m>a</m>.
      There is no a priori reason why theses two things should be the same.
      Try to think back to when you first learned this arithmetic stuff<ndash/>at that time,
      it probably wasn't as obvious as it seems now.
      The exercise shows that it actually follows from even more basic facts about arithmetic.

      The preceding exercise gives us a proof of the following proposition,
      which we will need later in the book.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Preliminaries_sumIneq">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a,b,c,d</m> be integer, rational,
          or real numbers such that <m>a>b</m> and <m>c>d</m>.
          It follows that <m>a+c > b+d</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Finally, we're going to prove is that <m>-1</m> is negative.
      At this point you may be thinking,
      <q>Duh, it's got a minus sign,
      so of course it's negative!</q>
      But if you look back in <xref ref="subsec_Preliminaries_OpsAndRels">Section</xref>
      property (B), you'll see that the minus sign on <m>-1</m> just means that it's the additive inverse of the multiplicative identity 1.
      On the other hand,
      negative numbers were defined in <xref ref="subsec_Preliminaries_OrderRelations">Section</xref>
      as numbers that are less than the additive identity 0.
      Just because we've decided to write the additive inverse of 1 as <m>-1</m>,
      doesn't mean that we can automatically assume that <m>-1\lt 0</m>.
      Remember, be skeptical!
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Preliminaries_minusOne2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>-1 \lt 0</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        This will be our first exposure to a proof technique called
        <term>proof by contradiction</term>.
        We'll make use of this technique throughout the book.
        In this case, the idea goes as follows.
        There's no way that <m>-1</m> could be positive,
        because if it were then <m>1 + (-1)</m> would also have to be positive,
        which it isn't because we know it's 0.
        There's also no way that <m>-1</m> could be 0, because if it were we'd have <m>-1=0</m>,
        and adding 1 to both sides gives <m>0 = 1</m>,
        which is false because 1 is positive and 0 isn't.
        Since -1 isn't positive and it isn't equal to 0, the only option left is that it's negative.
        This is the gist of the argument,
        but we have to write it out more carefully to satisfy those nit-picking mathematicians.
        Every step in our argument must have a solid reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here goes the formal proof.
        We'll give a logical sequence of mathematical statements,
        followed by a reason that justifies each statement<ndash/>this is called
        <em>statement-reason format</em><idx><h>Proof</h><h>statement-reason format</h></idx>.
