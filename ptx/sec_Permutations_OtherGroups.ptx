    <title>Even and odd permutations</title>
    <p>
      We saw in the previous section that any permutation can be represented as a product of transpositions.
      However, this representation is not unique.
      Consider for instance:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>{\var id} = (1 2) ( 1 2)</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>{\var id} = (1 3 )(2 4 )(1 3 )( 2 4 )</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>{\var id} = (1 5 )(2 6 )(7 9 )( 1 4 )(3 4)(3 4)(1 4)(7 9)(2 6)(1 5)</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although these representations of
      <m>{\var id}</m> are vastly different, by some
      <q>strange coincidence</q>
      they all involve the product of an even number of transpositions.
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise_Permutations_id_odd_trans">
      <statement>
        <p>
          ***** Write <m>{\var id}</m> as a product of an odd number of transpositions (If you succeed,
          you automatically get an <m>A</m> in this course!)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      As you might guess from the previous exercise,
      there's something fishy going on here.
      To get to the bottom of this,
      we need to get a better handle on what happens when you multiply a permutation by a transposition.
      In particular,
      we know that any permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles:
      so what happens to these cycles when we multiply by a transposition?
      To get warmed up, let's first look at some special cases.
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise_Permutations_perm_trans_multiply">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Write <m>\tau \sigma</m> as the products of disjoint cycles,
          where <m>\sigma = (12345678)</m> and:
          <m>(a)~\tau= (25);~~ (b)~\tau= (16);~~ (c)~\tau=(48) ;~~ (d)~\tau=(35)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      As always it is helpful to have a good representation of the situation,
      preferably in pictures.
      For the following argument, we will represent a cycle as a
      <q>pearl necklace</q>, as shown in <xref ref="fig_pearl">Figure</xref>.
      This is not so different from our previous representation of cycles
      (for instance, in <xref ref="fig_cycle">Figure</xref>),
      but we are not including labels for the particular elements in the cycle because we want to emphasize the general structure and not get bogged down in details.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      <xref ref="fig_abC">Figure</xref>
      shows how we may represent the multiplication <m>(ab)C</m> of transposition <m>(ab)</m> with cycle <m>C</m>,
      where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are elements included within <m>C</m>.
      The transposition effectively redirects the arrow pointing into <m>a</m>,
      so that now it points into <m>b</m>.
      The transposition also redirects the arrow pointing into <m>b</m> so that it now points into <m>a</m>.
      As a result, there are now two cycles instead of one.
      The sum of the lengths of the two cycles is equal to the length of the original cycle.

    <p>
      Using this representation,
      we can now investigate what happens when we multiply a transposition <m>(ab)</m> times an <em>arbitrary</em>
      permutation <m>\sigma</m>.
      We already know that <m>\sigma</m> can be thought of as a collection of disjoint cycles
      (plus stationary elements, that are unaffected by <m>\sigma</m>).
      There are several possibilities for how <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> can fit within the cycles of <m>\sigma</m>,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_abC2">Figure</xref>.
      Each possibility may or may not change the number of cycles,
      as well as the sum of the lengths of all cycles.

      If you did the previous exercise correctly,
      you will find that no matter where the transposition falls,
      the entry in the last column is always <sq>odd</sq>.
      Consider what this means.
      Suppose I have a permutation <m>\sigma</m> whose sum of cycle lengths minus number of cycles is equal to <m>N</m>.
      I then multiply <m>\sigma</m> by a transposition to obtain another permutation <m>\tau</m>,
      whose sum of cycle lengths minus number of cycles is equal to <m>M</m>.
      The last column of <xref ref="transposition_table">Table</xref>shows that it must be true that <m>M-N</m> is <em>always</em> odd.
      In other words,
      if <m>M</m> is even then <m>N</m> is odd: and vice versa.
      We may express this concisely using the following definition:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {defparity} for any permutation <m>\sigma</m> written in disjoint cycle notation,
          the number
          <me>
            \text{ mod(sum of cycle lengths minus number of cycles,2) }
          </me>
          is called the <term>parity</term> of <m>\sigma</m>.
              <idx><h>Permutation</h><h>parity</h></idx>
          A permutation with parity 0 is called an
          <term>even permutation</term>,
          while a permutation with parity 1 is called an
          <term>odd permutation</term>.
          .

          Often books will use the terms
          <q>even parity</q>
          and
          <q>odd parity</q>
          instead of parity 0 and 1, respectively.

      Now here's the punch line.
      We know that <em>every</em> permutation can be written as a product of transpositions.
      From what we have just shown,
      an odd permutation must be the product of an odd number of transpositions;
      while an even permutation must be the product of an even number of transpositions.
      It is <em>impossible</em> to write an even permutation as the product of an odd number of transpositions;
      and vice versa.

          It also relates back to the discussion of Levi-Civita symbols in <xref ref="subsec_SigmaApp_LeviCivitaAndApp_LeviCivita">Section</xref>
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>\sigma</m> is a permutation in <m>S_4</m>.
          We can define a <m>4 \times 4</m> matrix
          <m>P_{\sigma}</m> using index notation as follows:
              <idx><h>Permutation</h><h>matrix</h></idx>
          <me>
            [P_{\sigma}]_{ij} = \begin{cases}1 \amp \text{ if }  j = \sigma(i), \\ 0 \amp \text{ if }  j \neq  \sigma(i). \end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          (Here <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> can take any values from 1 to 4.) The matrix
          <m>P_{\sigma}</m> is in fact known as the
          <term>permutation matrix</term>
          associated with the permutation <m>\sigma</m>.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <p>
                Write down the matrix <m>P_{\sigma}</m> when: (i)
                <m>\sigma = (13)</m>; (ii) <m>\sigma = (132)</m>; (iii)
                <m>\sigma = (12)(34)</m>; (iv) <m>\sigma = (1234)</m>.

            <li>

                Using the formula that you guessed in the previous problem,
                evaluate <m>\det P_{\sigma}</m> when: (i)
                <m>\sigma = (24)</m>; (ii) <m>\sigma = (143)</m>; (iii)
                <m>\sigma = (14)(23)</m>; (iv) <m>\sigma = (1423)</m>.
                Check your answer using the row
                (or column)
                expansion method for computing determinants.

                <m>[1,2,3,4]^T</m> times the matrix <m>P_{\sigma}</m>,
                you obtain the second row of the tableau for <m>\sigma</m>.
                In other words, the matrix <m>P_{\sigma}</m>

                the permutation <m>\sigma</m> on column vector entries.

    <title>The alternating group</title>
    <p>
      We have shown that all permutations are either even or odd.
      In other words,
      for any <m>n \in \mathbb{Z}</m> we have that <m>S_n</m> is the union of two disjoint sets:
      <m>S_n = A_n \cup B_n</m>,
      where <m>A_n</m> and <m>B_n</m> are the even and odd permutations respectively.
      We are particularly interested in the set <m>A_n</m>,
      because it has nice properties with respect to product of permutations:

      In light of the previous exercise,
      it's beginning to look like <m>A_n</m> could be a group under permutation product.
      Let's check off the group properties:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is <m>A_n</m> closed under permutation product?
            Yes, according to Ex.
            <xref ref="exercise_Permutations_A_nGroupProps"></xref>(c).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Does <m>A_n</m> have an identity element?
            Yes, according to Ex.
            <xref ref="exercise_Permutations_A_nGroupProps"></xref>(a).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Does <m>A_n</m> have inverses for every element?
            Yes, according to Ex.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is <m>A_n</m> associative?
            Yes, because the operation is composition,
            and composition is associative.

      We have thus essentially proven the following proposition:

    </exercise>
    <p>
      We know that <m>A_n</m> is a group <mdash/> but how big is it?
      Of course, it depends on the number of odd permutations <m>B_n</m>,
      since <m>A_n</m> and <m>B_n</m> together make up <m>S_n</m>.
      So which is bigger: <m>A_n</m> or <m>B_n</m>?
      The answer is <ellipsis/> neither!
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Permutations_Alternating1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The number of even permutations in <m>S_n</m>,
          <m>n \geq 2</m>, is equal to the number of odd permutations;
          hence, <m>| A_n | = n!/2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The key to the proof is showing that there is a <em>bijection</em>
        between <m>A_n</m> and <m>B_n</m>.
        Since a bijection is one-to-one and onto,
        this means that <m>A_n</m> and <m>B_n</m> must have exactly the same number of elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        To construct a bijection,
        notice that <m>(1 2) \in S_n</m> and define a function <m>f: A_n \rightarrow S_n</m> by:
        <m>f(\sigma) = (1 2) \compose \sigma</m>. (Notice that we are taking <m>A_n</m> as our domain,
        and not <m>S_n</m>).
        To show that <m>f</m> is a bijection,
        we need to show three things:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>B_n</m> is a valid codomain for <m>f</m>:
              that is, <m>f(\sigma) \in B_n ~\forall \sigma \in A_n</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f:A_n \rightarrow B_n</m> is onto:
              that is, <m>\forall \mu \in B_n ~\exists \sigma \in A_n</m> such that <m>f(\sigma) = \mu</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f</m> is one-to-one: that is,
              <m>f(\sigma_1) = f(\sigma_2)</m> implies <m>\sigma_1 = \sigma_2</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
