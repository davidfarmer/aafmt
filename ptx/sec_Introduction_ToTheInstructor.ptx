  <title>To the instructor</title>
  <p>
    This book is not intended for budding mathematicians.
    It was created for a math program in which most of the students in upper-level math classes are planning to become secondary school teachers.
    For such students,
    conventional abstract algebra texts are practically incomprehensible,
    both in style and in content.
    Faced with this situation,
    we decided to create a book that our students could actually read for themselves.
    In this way we have been able to dedicate class time to problem-solving and personal interaction rather than rehashing the same material in lecture format.

    Admittedly it falls short of the typical syllabus for an upper-level abstract algebra class.
    But what's the point of covering the syllabus,
    if the students don't retain anything?
    The unhappy fact is that many students at this level haven't yet mastered the important basic examples
    (complex numbers, etc.)
    that provide motivation,
    so it's unrealistic to expect them to grasp abstractions if they don't even understand what's being abstractified.So instead we have dived deeply into basic examples<ndash/>and these are the just the basic examples that will be most useful to those who go on to a career in high school teaching.

    The book is highly modular,
    and chapters may be readily omitted if students are already familiar with the material.
    Some chapters (
    <q>Preliminaries</q>
    and
    <q>Sigma Notation</q>
    ) are remedial.
    Other chapters cover topics that are often covered in courses in discrete mathematics,
    such as sets,
    functions, and equivalence classes.
    (Much of this material is taken from the Morris' book,
    with some amplifications.)
    We have found from experience that students need this re-exposure in order to gain the necessary facility with these concepts,
    on which so much of the rest of the book is based.
  </p>

    Whenever possible we have introduced applications,
    which may be omitted at the instructor's discretion.
    However, we feel that it is critically important for preparing secondary teachers to be familiar with these applications.
    They will remember these long after they have forgotten proofs they have learned,
    and they may even be able to convey some of these ideas to their own students.
