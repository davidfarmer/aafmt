  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_ExploringPolynomials_phi_onto">Exercise</xref>: Look at the examples of
    <m>M=\phi_m(p(x)</m> that we've computed so far,
    and see how the first column of <m>M</m> relates to the coefficients of <m>p(x)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_ExploringPolynomials_propPhi">Exercise</xref>: Use the distributive property,
    exponent rules,
    and the operation-preserving properties of <m>\phi</m>.
