    <blockquote>
      <q>In all the arts it is symmetry that gives pleasure, preserving unity, and making the whole beautiful.</q>
      (Augustine, <em>Of True Religion</em>, xxx.55 (Tr. J. H. S. Burleigh)
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <q>It is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry.</q>
      (Philip W. Anderson, 1977 Nobel laureate in physics)
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <q>So our problem is to explain where symmetry comes from. Why is nature so nearly symmetrical? No one has any idea why.</q>
      (Richard Feynman, 1965 Nobel laureate in physics)
    </blockquote>

      The above quotes give some flavor of the importance and the mystery of symmetry,
      in both art and science.
      In keeping with our practice throughout this book,
      we will introduce this general topic by means of a basic example,
      namely symmetries of plane figures.
      Many of the concepts that you will learn in this chapter are applicable to symmetries in general.
      In particular: wherever you find a symmetry,
      you will always find a <em>group</em> lurking behind it
      (see <xref ref="subsec_ModularArithmetic_DefOfGroup">Section</xref>
      for the mathematical definition of a group).
