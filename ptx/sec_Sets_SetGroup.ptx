    Some of the properties in <xref ref="proposition_Sets_sets_theorem_set_ops">Proposition</xref> may ring a bell.
    Recall that in the <xref ref="subsec_ModularArithmetic_DefOfGroup">Section</xref>
    of the Modular Arithmetic chapter we defined a <em>group</em>
        <idx><h>Group</h><h>definition</h></idx>
    to be a set combined with an operation that has the following properties:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set is <em>closed</em> under the operation (in other words,
          the operation has the property of <em>closure</em>);
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set has a unique <em>identity</em>;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Every element of the set has its own <em>inverse</em>;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set elements satisfy the <em>associative property</em>
          under the group operation;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Some</em> groups satisfy the
          <em>commutative property</em>
          under the group operation.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you forgot what these properties mean,
    look back at <xref ref="subsec_ModularArithmetic_ClosureZn">Section</xref>
    and the following subsections,
    where we discuss these properties as applied to the integers mod <m>n</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    What we're going to do now is a first taste of a magic recipe that you're going to see again and again in Abstract Algebra.
    We're going to turn <em>sets</em> into <em>elements</em>.
    Abracadabra!
  </p>
  <p>
    What do we mean by this?
    Let's take an example.
    Take the 3-element set <m>S = \{a,b,c\}</m>.
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Sets_31">
    <statement>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p>
            List the <em>subsets</em> of <m>S = \{a,b,c\}</m>.
            Include the empty set and non-proper subsets of <m>S</m>.
            How many subsets are in your list?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you listed the subsets of <m>\{a,b\}</m>,
            how many subsets would be in your list?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you listed the subsets of <m>\{a,b,c,d\}</m>,
            how many subsets would be in your list?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            *If you listed the subsets of <m>\{a,b,c,\ldots,x,y,z\}</m>,
            how many subsets would be in your list? (*Hint*)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    Let's take the list of subsets of
    <m>\{a,b,c\}</m> that you came up with in part (a) of the previous exercise.
    We can consider this list as a set of 8 elements,
    where each element is a subset of the original set <m>S = \{a,b,c\}</m>.
    Let's call this 8-element set <m>G</m>.
    Remember, the elements of <m>G</m> are <em>subsets</em>
    of the original set <m>S</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So now let's face the question: Is <m>G</m> a group?
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that a group has a single <em>operation</em>:
        <idx><h>Operation</h><h>definition of</h></idx>
    that is, a way of combining two elements to obtain a third element.
    We actually have two candidates for an operation for <m>G</m>:
    either intersection or union.
    So we actually have two questions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Is <m>G</m> with the operation <m>\cup</m> a group?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Is <m>G</m> with the operation <m>\cap</m> a group?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    We'll take these questions one at a time.
    First we investigate group properties for the set <m>G</m> with the operation <m>\cup</m>:
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Sets_cup_group">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be the set of subsets of the set <m>\{a,b,c\}</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              Does the set <m>G</m> with the operation <m>\cup</m> have the closure property?
              <em>Justify</em> your answer.

          <li>
            <p>
              Does the set <m>G</m> with the operation <m>\cup</m> have an identity?
              If so, what is it?

            <p>

              enabled you to draw this conclusion?
              If not, provide a counterexample.

          <li>
            <p>
              Is the set <m>G</m> a group under the <m>\cup</m> operation?
              <em>Justify</em> your answer.

          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    Although <xref ref="exercise_Sets_cup_group">Exercise</xref>
    deals with a particular set of subsets,
    the results of the exercise are completely general and apply to the set of any subsets of <em>any</em>
    set (and not just <m>\{a,b,c\}</m>.

  <p>
    Now we'll consider <m>\cap</m>:

  <p>
    No doubt you're bitterly disappointed that neither <m>\cap</m> nor <m>\cup</m> can be used to define a group.
    However, take heart!
    Mathematicians use these operations to define a different sort of algebraic structure called
    (appropriately enough)
    a <em>Boolean algebra</em>.
    We won't deal further with Boolean algebras in this course:
    suffice it to say that mathematicians have defined a large variety of abstract algebraic structures for different purposes.

  <p>
    Although <m>\cap</m> and <m>\cup</m> didn't work,
    there is a consolation prize:
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Sets_symm_diff">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Besides <m>\cup</m> and <m>\cap</m>,
        there is another set operation called
        <em>symmetric difference</em>,<idx><h>Set operations</h><h>symmetric difference</h></idx> which is sometimes denoted by the symbol <m>\Delta</m> and is defined as:
        <me>
          A \Delta B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B\setminus A)
        </me>.

        Given a set <m>U</m>,
        let <m>G</m> be the set of all subsets of <m>U</m>.
        Repeat parts (a)<ndash/>(f) of <xref ref="exercise_Sets_cap_group">Exercise</xref>,
        but this time for the set operation <m>\Delta</m> instead of <m>\cap</m>.
