  <title>Further Topics in Cryptography</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter we examine two specific topics in cryptography which are highly practical and are relatively recent developments: Diffie-Hellman key exchange
      (originated by W. Diffie and M. Hellman in 1976)
      and elliptic curve cryptography
      (proposed by N. Koblitz and V. Miller in 1985).

      <em>Prerequisites</em>: To understand this chapter,
      the reader should be familiar with the material in <xref ref="ModularArithmetic">Chapters</xref>,
      <xref ref="Functions"></xref>,
      and <xref ref="Groups"></xref>.
      We also make use of one important result from <xref ref="Isomorphism">Chapter</xref>,
      but we only apply the result and don't make use of the proof itself.
