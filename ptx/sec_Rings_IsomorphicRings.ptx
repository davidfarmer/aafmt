  <title>Isomorphic rings</title>
  <p>
    Sometimes we encounter rings that are basically the
    <q>same</q>. In this section we will give a mathematical definition for what the
    <q>same</q>
    means in this context.
    Before we give the definition,
    we will start out with an example.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the two rings <m>R_1={\mathbb Z}[x]</m> and <m>R_2={\mathbb Z}[y]</m>.
        Obviously, these two rings are basically the same except we replace <m>x</m> with <m>y</m>.
        We can make a formal correspondence between the two rings by defining a function <m>\phi:R_1\rightarrow R_2</m> as follows:
        <m>\phi(a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots +a_0)=(a_ny^n+a_{n-1}y^{n-1}+\ldots +a_0)</m>.
        Note that <m>\phi</m> is a bijection because it has an inverse
        (see <xref ref="proposition_Functions_InverseBijection">Proposition</xref>).
        Additionally,
        <m>\phi</m> preserves the operations of addition and multiplication:
        <m>\phi(x+_1y)=\phi(x)+_2\phi(y)</m> and <m>\phi(x\cdot_1y)=\phi(x)\cdot_2\phi(y)</m>.
        In other words, <m>\phi</m> gives us a way to
        <q>translate</q>
        every operation we do in <m>R_1</m> to a corresponding operation in <m>R_2</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    The above example may seem trivial,
    but it turns out that in some cases similar construction can make deep connections between rings that seem quite different:
  </p>
  <example xml:id="example_Rings_phi_matrix">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the function <m>\phi:R_1\rightarrow R_2</m>, where
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>R_1=\{z=a+bi\in{\mathbb C}\}</m>,
        <m>R_2=\left\{A= \begin{bmatrix}a \amp b\\ -b \amp a \end{bmatrix} \in{\mathbb M}_2\right\}</m> and <m>\phi</m> is defined as:
        <m>\phi(a+bi)= \begin{bmatrix}a \amp b\\ -b \amp a \end{bmatrix}</m>.
        We can see that <m>\phi</m> is also a bijection since
        <m>\phi^{-1}\left( \begin{bmatrix}a \amp b\\ -b \amp a \end{bmatrix} \right) =a+bi</m>,
        for all <m>A\in R_2</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To further explore the structure of the function <m>\phi</m>,
        let's consider two arbitrary elements of <m>R_1</m>,
        say <m>z=a+bi</m> and <m>w=c+di</m>.
        Using addition of complex numbers,
        then applying the <m>\phi</m> function, we get
        <md>
          <mrow>\phi(z+w)\amp =\phi(a+bi+c+di)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\phi((a+c)+(b+d)i)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \begin{bmatrix} a+c \amp  b+d</mrow>
          <mrow>-b-d \amp  a+c \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We get the same result if we first apply the <m>\phi</m> function on <m>z</m> and <m>w</m>,
        then use addition of matrices:
        <md>
          <mrow>\phi(z)+\phi(w)\amp =\phi(a+bi)+\phi(c+di)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \begin{bmatrix} a \amp  b</mrow>
          <mrow>-b \amp  a \end{bmatrix}+ \begin{bmatrix} c \amp  d</mrow>
          <mrow>-d \amp  c \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \begin{bmatrix} a+c \amp  b+d</mrow>
          <mrow>-b-d \amp  a+c \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, <m>\phi(z+_1w)=\phi(z)+_2\phi(w)</m>,
        where <m>+_1</m> and <m>+_2</m> are addition as defined by <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m>,
        respectively.
        But what about multiplication?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's consider <m>z</m> and <m>w</m> as defined earlier.
        We can see that
        <md>
          <mrow>\phi(z\cdot w)\amp =\phi((a+bi)\cdot(c+di))</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\phi((ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \begin{bmatrix} ac-bd \amp  ad+bc</mrow>
          <mrow>-ad-bc \amp  ac-bd \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that multiplication of complex numbers was used here.
        Also,
        <md>
          <mrow>\phi(z)\cdot\phi(w)\amp =\phi(a+bi)\cdot\phi(c+di)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \begin{bmatrix} a \amp  b</mrow>
          <mrow>-b \amp  a \end{bmatrix}\cdot \begin{bmatrix} c \amp  d</mrow>
          <mrow>-d \amp  c \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \begin{bmatrix} ac-bd \amp  ad+bc</mrow>
          <mrow>-ad-bc \amp  ac-bd \end{bmatrix}</mrow>
        </md>,
        where multiplication of matrices was used.
        So, <m>\phi(z\cdot_1 w)=\phi(z)\cdot_2\phi(w)</m>,
        where <m>\cdot_1</m> and <m>\cdot_2</m> are multiplication as defined by <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m>,
        respectively.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    The two examples above show how we can relate different rings that have the same structure.
    In both examples we use a bijection that preserves the addition and multiplication operations to make a correspondence between two rings.
    We may generalize this type of bijection as follows.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        {Isomorphism} Let <m>\phi:R_1\rightarrow R_2</m> be a bijection between rings <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m>.
        We say that <m>\phi</m> is an <term>isomorphism</term>
        from <m>R_1</m> to <m>R_2</m> if the following two equations are satisfied for all <m>x,y\in R_1</m>:
        <men xml:id="iso_add">
          \phi(x+_1y)=\phi(x)+_2\phi(y)
        </men>
        <men xml:id="iso_mult">
          \phi(x\cdot_1y)=\phi(x)\cdot_2\phi(y)
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        Two rings <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m> are called <term>isomorphic</term>
        if there exists an isomorphism from <m>R_1</m> to <m>R_2</m>.

  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Rings_matrixIso">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\phi: R_1\rightarrow R_2</m>,
        where <m>R_1={\mathbb Q}[\sqrt{2}]=\{a+b\sqrt{2}: a,b\in{\mathbb Q}\}</m> and <m>R_2=\left\{ \begin{bmatrix}a \amp b \sqrt{2}\\ b \sqrt{2} \amp a \end{bmatrix} \in{\mathbb M}_2\right\}</m>.
        Prove or disprove that <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <example xml:id="example_Rings_conjugate">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that <m>f:{\mathbb C}\rightarrow{\mathbb C}</m> is an isomorphism,
        where <m>f</m> maps every element of
        <m>{\mathbb C}</m> to its complex conjugate in <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
        In other words, if <m>z=a+bi\in{\mathbb C}</m>,
        where <m>a,b\in{\mathbb R}</m>,
        then <m>f(z)=a-bi\in{\mathbb C}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        In order for <m>f</m> to be an isomorphism,
        we must first show that the sets are indeed rings and that the function <m>f</m> is a bijection.
        Then we must show that the two equations above are true for all <m>z,w\in{\mathbb C}</m>.
        At the beginning of this chapter,
        we concluded that <m>{\mathbb C}</m> satisfies all seven properties of a ring.
        Also, given any <m>w=a-bi\in{\mathbb C}</m>,
        <m>f^-1(w)=a+bi\in{\mathbb C}</m>.
        So <m>f</m> is a bijection.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we continue, remember that <m>+_1, \cdot_1</m> and
        <m>+_2, \cdot_2</m> refer to addition and multiplication as defined by the first and second rings,
        respectively.
        In our case,
        both additions are regular complex addition and both multiplications are regular complex multiplication.
        So we will use <m>+</m> to represent both <m>+_1</m> and <m>+_2</m> and similarly for <m>\cdot</m>.
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
              First we must show that <m>f(z+w)=f(z)+f(w)</m>,
              for any <m>z,w\in{\mathbb C}</m>.
              We begin with our two arbitrary elements of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>,
              <m>z=a+bi</m> and <m>w=c+di</m>,
              where <m>a,b,c,d\in{\mathbb R}</m>.
              Then
              <md>
                <mrow>f(z+w)\amp =f((a+bi)+(c+di)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp =f((a+c)+(b+d)i)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp =(a+c)-(b+d)i</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp =a+c-bi-di</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp =(a-bi)+(c-di)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp =f(z)+f(w)</mrow>
              </md>.
              So property one of isomorphisms is satisfied.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Secondly, we must show that <m>f(z\cdot w)=f(z)\cdot f(w)</m>.
              Using <m>z</m> and <m>w</m> as defined above,
              <md>
                <mrow>f(z\cdot w)\amp =f((a+bi)\cdot(c+di))</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp =f((ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp =(ac-bd)-(ad+bc)i</mrow>
              </md>.
              On the other hand,
              <md>
                <mrow>f(z)\cdot f(w)\amp =f(a+bi)\cdot f(c+di)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp =(a-bi)(c-di)</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp =(ac-bd)-(ad+bc)i</mrow>
              </md>
              This shows <m>f(z\cdot w)=f(z)\cdot f(w)</m>,
              so property two of isomorphisms is satisfied.
