    <title>Tableaus and cycles</title>
    <p>
      In the Symmetries chapter,
      we introduced tableau notation to deal with bijections because of its brevity and ease of use for function composition.
      But as you may have noticed in the last section,
      even tableaus can become cumbersome to work with.
      To work effectively with permutation groups,
      we need a more streamlined method of writing down and manipulating permutations.
      This method is known as cycle notation.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Permutations_permute_to_cycle_1">
      <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>\rho \in S_6</m> and <m>\rho = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \amp  4 \amp  5 \amp  6 \\ 2 \amp  3 \amp  4 \amp  5 \amp  6 \amp  1 \end{pmatrix}</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          \rho(1) = 2,\  \rho(2) = 3,\  \rho(3) = 4,\  \rho(4) = 5,\  \rho(5) = 6,\  \text{ and }  \rho(6) = 1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A shorter way to represent this is
        <me>
          1 \to 2, 2 \to 3, 3 \to 4, 4 \to 5, 5 \to 6 \mbox { and } 6 \to 1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can visualize this as a
        <q>wheel</q>, as shown in <xref ref="fig_cycle">Figure</xref>

        We shall write this trail of inputs and outputs as <m>(123456)</m>;
            <idx><h>Cycle notation</h></idx>
        and rather than
        <q>wheel</q>, we call this a <term>cycle</term>.
            <idx><h>Permutation</h><h>cycle</h></idx>
        Reading the cycle from left to right indicates that 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, <m>\ldots</m>,
        and the 6 at the end goes back to 1.

      <p>
        From the previous two exercises,
        it is clear that there are many ways to write the same cycle:
        we can begin with any element we want,
        and work our way around until we get back to the same element.
        To avoid possible confusion,
        from now on we will follow the convention of starting the cycle with the
        <q>smallest</q>
        or
        <q>first</q>
        element of the domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this particular permutation,
        since our cycle contains all the inputs in the domain of <m>\rho</m>,
        it represents the whole function
        (because it gives us the outputs for every input).
        Therefore in cycle notation,
        <me>
          \rho = (123456)

    <remark>
      <p>
        Notice how we have used the notation <m>a_j</m> to indicate arbitrary elements in a cycle.
        This is a common practice in abstract algebra.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      Now not all permutations in <m>S_6</m> correspond to a cycle of length six.
      For instance:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Permutations_permute_to_cycle_3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>\tau \in S_6</m> and <m>\tau = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \\ 1 \amp 4 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 5 \amp 6 \end{pmatrix}</m>.
          Then

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>1 \to 1</m>, which means that <m>1</m>
                <q>stays put.</q>
                So we don't use <m>1</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>2 \to 4</m>, <m>4 \to 3</m>, and <m>3 \to 2</m>;
                so we have <m>(243)</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                Finally, <m>5 \to 5</m> and <m>6 \to 6</m>;
                so they also stay put.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence
          <me>
            \tau = (243)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Based on the procedure in the previous example then,
      how would we represent the identity permutation on a set of <m>n</m> elements?
      All the elements stay put, so technically <m>{\var id}</m> would equal the
      <q>empty cycle</q>. Some references in fact use
      <q><m>()</m></q>
      to denote the identity:
      but in this book we will always denote the identity permutation by
      <m>{\var id}</m> as a reminder that this is in fact the group's identity element.

    <warning xml:id="cycle_domain">
      <p>
        Cycle notation does not indicate the domain of the permutation.
        For instance,
        the permutation <m>(243)</m> in <xref ref="example_Permutations_permute_to_cycle_3">Example</xref>
        had domain <m>\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}</m>,

        When working with permutations in cycle notation,

      all cycles correspond to some permutation in <m>S_n</m>.
      However, can all permutations in <m>S_n</m> be represented as a cycle?
      We will take the next several parts of this section to explore this question.

    <title>Composition (a.k.a. product) of cycles</title>
    <p>
      Since cycles represent permutations,
      they can be composed together.
      If we change the cycles to tableaus,
      we know how to compose them.
      Now let's figure out how to compose them using the cycles themselves.

    <notation>
      <p>
        Given permutations <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m>,
        instead of writing <m>\sigma \compose \tau</m> we write the shorthand notation:
        <m>\sigma \tau</m>.
        Furthermore,
        instead of calling this the composition of <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m>,
        we refer to it as the <term>product</term>
        of <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m>.<fn>
        Once again we see mathematicians' annoying habit of reusing familiar terms to mean something new in a different contexts.
        In this case, the

        of permutations means something quite different from ordinary multiplication.

    <example xml:id="example_Permutations_cycle_comp_1">
      <statement>

          Suppose we want to form the product

        <p>
          <xref ref="fig_cycle_composition">Figure</xref>
          provides a visual representation of how the product <m>\sigma \tau</m> acts on 1.
          Remember that we operate from right to left,
          so the figure shows <sq>1</sq> coming in from the right.
          The action of <m>\tau</m> takes 1 to 2. ( For convenience we have
          <q>flattened</q>
          the permutations <m>\tau</m> and <m>\sigma</m>,
          so they no longer appear as circles.) Then we pass over to <m>\sigma</m>,
          which takes 2 to 1.
          The final result is 1: therefore <m>\sigma(\tau(1)) = 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evidently 1 remains unchanged by the permutation,
          so let's look at what happens to 2.
          We see this in <xref ref="fig_cycle_composition2">Figure</xref>.
          First, <m>\tau</m> moves 2 to 6.
          Moving on to <m>\sigma</m>, we find that <m>\sigma</m> leaves the 6 unchanged.
          The result is that <m>\sigma(\tau(2)) = 6</m>.

        <p>
          We have seen that <m>\sigma\tau</m> takes 2 to 6:
          so now let's see where <m>\sigma\tau</m> takes 6. (Perhaps you can see that we're trying to build a cycle here.) The top part of <xref ref="fig_cycle_composition_finish">Figure</xref>
          uses the same process to show the result:
          <m>\sigma(\tau(6)) = 5</m>.
          The middle part of <xref ref="fig_cycle_composition_finish">Figure</xref>
          shows that <m>\sigma(\tau(5)) = 3</m>;
          and the bottom part of <xref ref="fig_cycle_composition_finish">Figure</xref>
          shows that <m>\sigma(\tau(3)) = 2</m>.
          We already know that <m>\sigma(\tau(2)) = 6</m>,
          so we have closed out our cycle.
          We have shown <m>2 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2</m>,
          which amounts to the cycle: <m>(2653)</m>.

          So far 4 is unaccounted for:

          shows that 4 is not affected by either <m>\tau</m> or <m>\sigma</m>.
          So the entire action of <m>\tau</m> followed by <m>\sigma</m> is summarized by the cycle <m>(2653)</m>,
          meaning that we can write:
          <m>\sigma \tau</m> = <m>(2653)</m>.

      This permutation can't be represented by one cycle,
      but rather by <em>two</em> disjoint cycles.
      So we have an answer to our previous question:
      all cycles are permutations, but not all permutations are cycles.
      Some are represented by two disjoint cycles:
      and in fact some are represented by more than two disjoint cycles.

          Then

                <m>1 \to 6</m>, <m>6 \to 2</m>, and <m>2 \to 1</m>;

          We may represent this process graphically as follows.
          The permutation <m>\mu</m> is also a binary relation,
          and thus can be represented as a digraph as shown in <xref ref="Permutations_cycle_rep">Figure</xref>(a).
          We can make the digraph appear much simpler by rearranging the vertices as in <xref ref="Permutations_cycle_rep">Figure</xref>(b).
          We shall see that <em>all</em> permutations can be simplified in this manner.

            it's enough to show that they are the same function.
            In other words, we just need to show that

                  so <m>\underline{ ~\lt 16>~}(x) \notin \underline{ ~\lt 17>~}</m>.
                  We then have <m>\sigma \tau (x) = \underline{ ~\lt 18>~} = \underline{ ~\lt 19>~}(x)</m>.
                  It follows that <m>\sigma \tau (x) = \tau \sigma (x)</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  In this case,
                  since <m>x \notin A</m> it follows that <m>\underline{ ~\lt 20>~}(x) = x</m>.
                  Similarly since <m>x \notin \underline{ ~\lt 21>~}</m> it follows that <m>\underline{ ~\lt 22>~}(x) = x</m>.We then have
                  <m>\tau \sigma (x) = \underline{ ~\lt 23>~}</m> and <m>\sigma \tau (x) = \underline{ ~\lt 24>~}</m>.
                  It follows that <m>\sigma \tau (x) = \tau \sigma (x)</m>.

            </ol>

          <p>
            In all three cases we have
            <m>\sigma \tau (x)</m> = <m>\underline{ ~\lt 25>~}</m>,
            so therefore <m>\sigma \tau = \tau \sigma</m>.

      What we've discovered about products of two disjoint cycles is also true for products of any number of disjoint cycles.
      Since disjoint cycles act independently, they all commute.

      Finally, now that we know how to deal with permutation compositions that simplify to disjoint cycles,
      we can now compose any set of permutations we want.
      We will start with a couple examples.

    <example xml:id="example_Permutations_cycle_comp_3">

          write <m>\mu \rho</m> in cycle notation.
          <ul>

                <m>3 \to 4</m>, and <m>4 \to 4</m>;
                therefore <m>1 \to 4</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>4 \to 4</m>, <m>4 \to 4</m>,
                <m>4 \to 1</m>, and <m>1 \to 1</m>;
                therefore <m>4 \to 1</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          This gives us the cycle <m>(14)</m>.
          Continuing,
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>2 \to 2</m>, <m>2 \to 6</m>,
                <m>6 \to 6</m>, and <m>6 \to 6</m>;

                <m>5 \to 5</m>, and <m>5 \to 7</m>;
                therefore <m>6 \to 7</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>7 \to 1</m>, <m>1 \to 1</m>,
                <m>1 \to 3</m>, and <m>3 \to 3</m>;
                therefore <m>7 \to 3</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>3 \to 7</m>, <m>7 \to 7</m>,
                <m>7 \to 7</m>, and <m>7 \to 2</m>;
                therefore <m>3 \to 2</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we have the cycle <m>(2673)</m>.
          Now the only input not included in our cycles is <m>5</m>,
          so logically it should stay put.
          But let's test it just in case we made a mistake in our work above.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>5 \to 5</m>, <m>5 \to 2</m>,
                <m>2 \to 2</m>, and <m>2 \to 5</m>;
                therefore <m>5</m> does indeed stay put.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          So, we finally have: <m>\mu \rho = (14)(2673)</m>

    <title>Cycle structure of permutations</title>
    <p>
      Over the last several subsections,
      we've seen permutations represented as no cycles (<m>{\var id}</m>),
      a single cycle, or the product of any number of disjoint cycles.
      This worked because both a single cycle and a product of disjoint cycles can't be reduced to a simpler form in cycle notation.
      Are there any other possibilities?
      Are there permutations that can't be represented as either a single cycle or a product of disjoint cycles?
      The answer to this compelling question is given in the following proposition.
      This type of proposition is called an
      <q>existence and uniqueness</q>
      statement, and for convenience we'll divide the statement into two parts:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Permutations_perm_simple_notation">
      <statement>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <p>
              Every permutation <m>\sigma</m> in <m>S_n</m> can be written either as the identity,
              a single cycle, or as the product of disjoint cycles.

              These disjoint cycles are <em>uniquely</em>
              determined by the permutation <m>\sigma</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The following proof is a formalized version of the procedure we've been using to change permutations from tableau form to cycle notation.
      Admittedly, it looks intimidating.
      However, we include it for your
      <q>cultural enrichment</q>, because higher-level mathematics is typically like this.
      It's often the case that particular examples of a certain principle are relatively easy to explain,
      but constructing a general proof that covers <em>all</em>
      cases is much more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before starting the proof,
      we remind you that the notation <m>\sigma = (a_1 \, a_2 \, \ldots \, a_n)</m> means:
      <md>
        <mrow>\sigma( a_1 )  = a_2  \amp  \amp \sigma( a_2 )  = a_3 \amp \ldots   \amp  \ldots \amp \sigma( a_k )  = a_1</mrow>
      </md>,
      and <m>\sigma( x) =x</m> for all other elements <m>x \in X</m>.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let's begin with (a) We can assume that <m>X = \{ 1, 2, \ldots,
        n \}</m>.
        Let <m>\sigma \in S_n</m>,
        and define <m>X_1 = \{1, \sigma(1), \sigma^2(1), \ldots \}</m>.
        The set <m>X_1</m> is finite since <m>X</m> is finite.
        Therefore the sequence <m>1, \sigma(1), \sigma^2(1), \ldots</m> must repeat.
        Let <m>j_1</m> be the first index where the sequence repeats,
        so that <m>\sigma^{j_1}(1) = \sigma^k(1)</m> for some <m>k \lt j_1</m>.
        Then if we apply <m>\sigma^{-1}</m> to both sides of the equation we get <m>\sigma^{j_1-1}(1) = \sigma^{k-1}(1)</m>.
        Repeating this <m>k-1</m> more times gives <m>\sigma^{j_1-k}(1) = 1</m>.
        This implies that the sequence repeats at index <m>j_1-k</m>:
        but we've already specified that <m>j_1</m> is the <em>first</em>
        index where the sequence repeats.
        The only way this can happen is if <m>k=0</m>.
        It follows that <m>X_1 = \{1, \sigma(1), \sigma^2(1), \ldots \sigma^{j_1-1}(1) \}</m>,
        where <m>\sigma^{j_1}(1) = 1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now there are two possible cases:
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>X_1</m> accounts for all the integers in <m>X</m>; i.e.
              <m>X_1 = X</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              there are some integers in <m>X</m> not accounted for in <m>X_1</m>
              (that is, <m>X \backslash X_1 \neq \emptyset</m>).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        If case (ii) holds, then let <m>i</m> be the smallest integer in
        <m>X \backslash X_1</m> and define <m>X_2</m> by <m>\{ i, \sigma(i), \sigma^2(i), \ldots \}</m>.
        Just as with <m>X_1</m>, we may conclude that <m>X_2</m> is a finite set,
        and that <m>X_2</m> = <m>\{ i, \sigma(i), \ldots, \sigma^{j_2-1}(i) \}</m> where <m>\sigma^{j_2}(i) = i</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We claim furthermore that <m>X_1</m> and <m>X_2</m> are disjoint.
        We can see this by contradiction:
        <em>suppose</em> on the other hand that <m>X_1</m> and <m>X_2</m> are not disjoint.
        Then it must be the case that
        <m>\sigma^p(1) = \sigma^q(i)</m> for some natural numbers
        <m>p,
        q</m> with <m>0 \le p \lt j_1</m> and <m>0 \le q \lt j_2</m>.
        Applying <m>\sigma</m> to both sides of this equation,
        gives <m>\sigma^{p+1}(1) = \sigma^{q+1}(i)</m>.
        If we continue applying <m>\sigma</m> to both sides a total of <m>j_2 - q</m> times then we obtain <m>\sigma^{p+j_2 - q}(1) = \sigma^{j_2}(i)</m>.
        But since <m>\sigma^{j_2}(i) = i</m>,
        it follows that <m>\sigma^{p+j_2 - q}(1) = i</m>,
        which implies that <m>i \in X_1</m>.
        This is a contradiction, because we know <m>i \in X \backslash X_1</m>.
        The contradiction shows that the
        <em>supposition</em> must be false,
        so <m>X_1</m> and <m>X_2</m> are disjoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuing in the same manner,
        we can define finite disjoint sets <m>X_3, X_4, \ldots</m>.
        Since <m>X</m> is a finite set,
        we are guaranteed that this process will end and there will be only a finite number of these sets.
        Some of these sets <m>X_j</m> will have only a single element:
        in this case, <m>\sigma_j= \var{id}</m>,
        and it is not necessary to include these sets in the list.
        We may remove these sets,
        and relabel the remaining sets as <m>X_1,\ldots X_s</m>.
        If <m>\sigma_i</m> is the cycle defined by
        <me>
          \sigma_i( x ) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \sigma( x ) \amp  x \in X_i \\ x \amp  x \notin X_i, \end{array} \right.
        </me>
        then <m>\sigma = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \cdots \sigma_s</m>.
        Since the sets <m>X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_r</m> are disjoint,
        the cycles <m>\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_s</m> must also be disjoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now recall case (i) above.
        In this case, <m>\sigma = \sigma_1</m>.
        Hence, <m>\sigma</m> is either a single cycle or the product of <m>r</m> disjoint cycles.Note that if <m>\sigma = \var{id}</m>,
        then the process described above will yield all single-element sets,
        so that <m>r=0</m> and <m>\{X_1,\ldots X_r\}=</m>
        (this is why we treat the <m>\var{id}</m> as a special case).
        But if <m>\sigma \neq \var{id}</m>,
        the process will create at least one cycle of length <m>\ge 2</m>.
        This completes the proof of (a).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now on to (b).
        To show uniqueness of the disjoint cycles,
        we suppose that <m>\sigma = \sigma_1 \ldots \sigma_s</m> and also <m>\sigma = \rho_1 \ldots \rho_r</m>,
        where the <m>\sigma_j</m>'s are disjoint cycles and the <m>\rho_j</m>'s are also disjoint cycles.
        The proof may be accomplished by showing that <m>S = R</m>,
        where <m>S := \{\sigma_1,\ldots \sigma_s \}</m> and <m>R := \{\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_r\}</m>.
        To do this, we may show every cycle in <m>S</m> is also in <m>R</m>,
        and vice versa.
        So take <m>\sigma_j \in S</m>,
        and write <m>\sigma_j =(a_1 \, a_2 \, \ldots \, a_J)</m>.
        Since <m>\sigma_j(a_1) = a_2</m>,
        it follows that <m>\sigma(a_1) = a_2</m>.
        But this means that there must be a cycle
        <m>\rho_\ell \in R</m> such that <m>\rho_\ell(a_1) = a_2</m>.
        In the same way we may show that <m>\rho(a_2) = a_3, \ldots \rho(a_J)=a_1</m>.
        Since <m>\rho_{\ell}</m> is a cycle,
        it follows that <m>\rho_{\ell}(x) = x</m> for <m>x \notin \{a_1 \, a_2 \, \ldots \, a_J\}</m>.
        It follows that <m>\rho_\ell(x) = \sigma_j(x)</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>,
        and hence <m>\rho_\ell = \sigma_j</m>.
        Thus every element of <m>S</m> is also an element of <m>R</m>.
        The proof is then completed by the following exercise:

      <xref ref="proposition_Permutations_perm_simple_notation">Proposition</xref>
      is a <em>classification theorem</em>.
      You have seen classification theorems before:
      for instance,
      you know that any natural number <m>>1</m> can be written uniquely as the product of primes.
      <xref ref="proposition_Permutations_perm_simple_notation">Proposition</xref>
      similarly gives us a standard way to represent permutations.
      It allows us to characterize the types of permutations in <m>S_n</m> according to their cycle sizes,
      as shown in the following example.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Permutations_S5_cycle_types">
      <statement>
        <p>
          We know that every permutation in <m>S_5</m> is the product of disjoint cycles.
          Let us list all possible cycle lengths and number of cycles for the permutations of <m>S_5</m>.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                First of all,
                <m>S_5</m> contains the identity, which has no cycles.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Second, some permutations in <m>S_5</m> consist of a single cycle.
                The single cycle could have length 2, 3, 4, or 5
                (remember, we don't count cycles of length 1).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Third, some permutations in <m>S_5</m> consist of the product of two disjoint cycles.
                To enumerate these,
                suppose first that one of the cycles is a cycle of length 2.
                Then the other cycle could be a cycle of length 2 (for instance in the case
                <m>(12)(34)</m>) or a cycle of length 3 (as in the case <m>(14)(235)</m>).
                There are no other possibilities,
                because we only have 5 elements to permute,
                and a larger disjoint cycle would require more elements.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                It's not possible to have three or more disjoint cycles,
                because that would require at least six elements.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          To summarize then,
          the possible cycle structures for permutations in <m>S_5</m> are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The identity
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                single cycles of lengths 5, 4, 3, or 2
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                two disjoint cycles of lengths 2 and 3;
                and two disjoint cycles of lengths 2 and 2
              </p>
            </li>
