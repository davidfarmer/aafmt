      { Preamble}
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
      or other functional and useful document
      <q>free</q>
      in the sense of freedom:
      to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
      with or without modifying it,
      either commercially or noncommercially.
      Secondarily,
      this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work,
      while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      This License is a kind of
      <q>copyleft</q>, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
      It complements the GNU General Public License,
      which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
      because free software needs free documentation:
      a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.
      But this License is not limited to software manuals;
      it can be used for any textual work,
      regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
      We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
