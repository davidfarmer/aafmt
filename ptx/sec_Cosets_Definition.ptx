  <title>Definition of cosets</title>
  <p>
    The concept of
    <q>coset</q>
    brings together two ideas that we've seen before,
    namely <em>subgroups</em> and <em>equivalence classes</em>.
    We'll see how cosets arise from this mix by using a familiar example.

  <example xml:id="example_Cosets_ModArith">
    <statement>

      <em>(Modular addition d&#xe9;j&#xe0;
      vu all over again)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in <xref ref="ModularArithmetic">Chapter</xref>
      we defined modular equivalence
      (<xref ref="definition_ModularArithmetic_equivalence">Definition</xref>),
      and in <xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmetic_equivalence_alt">Proposition</xref>
      we gave an alternative characterization:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>a \equiv b \pmod{m}</m> iff <m>a - b = k \cdot m</m>,
      where <m>k</m> is an integer
      (that is, <m>k \in {\mathbb Z}</m>).
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <p>
              Give 4 integers <m>a</m> that satisfy the equation:

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Give 4 integers <m>a</m> that satisfy the equation:
              <m>a \equiv 2 \pmod{3}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_EquivalenceRelations_ModularArithmetic">Section</xref>
      in the Equivalence Relations chapter,
      we saw that modular equivalence was indeed an
      <em>equivalence relation</em>,
      and gave rise to <em>equivalence classes</em>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>[0]_3 = \{\mbox{All integers equivalent to 0 mod 3} \} = \{ \ldots -9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9 \ldots \}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>[1]_3 = \{\mbox{All integers equivalent to 1 mod 3} \} = \{ \ldots -8, -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, 10 \ldots \}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>[2]_3 = \{\mbox{All integers equivalent to 2 mod 3} \} = \{ \ldots -7, -4, -1, 2, 5, 8, 11 \ldots \}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in the Groups chapter we introduced an alternative notation for <m>[0]_3</m>,
      namely <m>3{\mathbb Z}</m>.
      Since every element of <m>[1]_3</m> is 1<nbsp/>+<nbsp/>an element of <m>3{\mathbb Z}</m>
      (and similarly for <m>[2]_3</m>)
      it makes sense to introduce the notation:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>[1]_3 = 1 + 3{\mathbb Z}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>[2]_3 = 2 + 3{\mathbb Z}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice the pattern here.
      Recall that <m>3{\mathbb Z}</m> is a
      <em>subgroup</em> of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.
      In order to
      <q>create</q>
      the equivalence class <m>1 + 3{\mathbb Z}</m>,
      we added a specific group element (namely, 1) to <em>every</em>
      element of the subgroup <m>3{\mathbb Z}</m>.
      The same holds true for <m>2 + 3{\mathbb Z}</m>.
      In both cases, the notation follows the pattern:
    </p>
    <p>
      (selected group element) (group operation)
      (subgroup).
    </p>
    <p>
      And, since every element of <m>[1]_3</m> can also be viewed as an element of <m>3{\mathbb Z}</m><nbsp/>+<nbsp/>1
      (and similarly for <m>[2]_3</m>),
      an alternative notation that makes sense is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>[1]_3 = 3{\mathbb Z} + 1</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>[2]_3 = 3{\mathbb Z} + 2</m>,
    </p>
    <p>
      which follows the pattern:
    </p>
    <p>
      (subgroup) (group operation)
      (selected group element).
    </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Cosets_equiv_class_mod5">
    <statement>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p>
            Write the 5 equivalence classes
            (subsets of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>)
            which make up <m>{\mathbb Z}_5</m> using our new notation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Write all elements of <m>{\mathbb Z}_7</m> using our new notation.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    The same pattern that we saw in the preceding example can actually be generalized to any group possessing a subgroup:
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        {def_coset} Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>H</m> a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
        The <term>left coset</term>
            <idx><h>Coset</h><h>left</h></idx>
        of <m>H</m> with <term> representative</term><idx><h>Coset</h><h>representative</h></idx> <m>g \in G</m> is defined as the following set:
        <me>
          gH = \{ gh : h \in H \}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Right cosets</term>
            <idx><h>Coset</h><h>right</h></idx>
        are defined similarly by
        <me>
          Hg = \{ hg : h \in H \}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Note that in the preceding equations,
        <q><m>gh</m></q>
        denotes <m>g \compose h</m> where
        <m>\compose</m> is the group operation.
        This is similar to our writing <m>xy</m> to denote
        <m>x \cdot y</m> in conventional algebra).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    <xref ref="definition_Cosets_def_coset">Definition</xref>
    looks a little different from <xref ref="example_Cosets_ModArith">Example</xref>,
    e.g. we have <m>gH</m> instead of <m>3 + {\mathbb Z}</m>.
    But in fact the pattern is the same:
    (group element)
    (group operation)
    (subgroup).
    If the group operation is +, we will typically write left cosets as <m>g + H</m> and right cosets as <m>H + g</m>.
    For all other group operations,
    we'll use the more compact notation <m>gH</m> and <m>Hg</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We should note also that <xref ref="definition_Cosets_def_coset">Definition</xref>
    enables us to express the same coset in multiple ways.
    For example,
    the coset <m>1 + 3\mathbb{Z}</m> described above could also be written as <m>4 + 3\mathbb{Z}</m> or
    <m>7 + 3\mathbb{Z}</m> or <m>-8 + 3\mathbb{Z}</m>.
    These all refer to the same subset of <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now <xref ref="definition_Cosets_def_coset">Definition</xref>
    distinguishes between <em>left</em>
    and <em>right</em> cosets.
    In our earlier discussion,the left coset <m>1 + 3{\mathbb Z}</m> and the right coset
    <m>3{\mathbb Z} + 1</m> were in fact the same set,
    as were <m>2 + 3{\mathbb Z}</m> and the right coset <m>3{\mathbb Z} + 2</m>.
    But left and right cosets are not always equal,
    as the following example shows.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="example_Cosets_S3_Cosets">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>H</m> be the subgroup of <m>S_3</m> defined by the permutations
        <m>\{(1), (123), (132) \}</m>. (Here we are using <m>(1)</m> to denote the identity permutation <m>{\var id}</m>.) to find cosets,
        we should take each element of <m>S_3</m> and multiply it by the three permutations in <m>H</m>.
        Recall the elements of <m>S_3</m> are <m>(1), (123), (132), (12), (13)</m>,
        and <m>(23)</m>.
        The left cosets of <m>H</m> are thus:
        <md>
          <mrow>(1)H = (1 2 3)H =  (132)H = \{(1), (1 23), (132) \},</mrow>
          <mrow>(1 2)H = (1 3)H = (2 3)H =  \{ (1 2), (1 3), (2 3)  \}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are 2 left cosets,
        and each coset can be expressed in 3 different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand,
        the right cosets of <m>H</m> may be computed similarly as:
        <md>
          <mrow>H(1) = H(1 2 3) =  H(132) = \{(1), (1 23), (132) \},</mrow>
          <mrow>H(1 2) = H(1 3) = H(2 3) =  \{ (1 2), (1 3), (2 3)  \}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So in this case once again the left cosets and right cosets are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand,
        let <m>K</m> be the subgroup of <m>S_3</m> defined by the permutations <m>\{(1), (1 2)\}</m>.
        Then the left cosets of <m>K</m> are
        <md>
          <mrow>(1)K = (1 2)K = \{(1), (1 2)\}</mrow>
          <mrow>(1 3)K = (1 2 3)K = \{(1 3), (1 2 3)\}</mrow>
          <mrow>(2 3)K = (1 3 2)K = \{(2 3), (1 3 2)\};</mrow>
        </md>
        and the right cosets of <m>K</m> are
        <md>
          <mrow>K(1) = K(1 2) = \{(1), (1 2)\}</mrow>
          <mrow>K(1 3) = K(1 3 2) = \{(1 3), (1 3 2)\}</mrow>
          <mrow>K(2 3) = K(1 2 3) = \{(2 3), (1 2 3)\}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The left and right cosets are <em>not</em> the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take note of something very striking about the previous two examples.
        First look at the case of <m>H \subset S_3</m>.
        In this case we ended up with 2 different left cosets,
        each of which could be expressed as <m>gH</m> in 3 different ways.
        For example, we saw that <m>(1 2)H = (1 3)H = (2 3)H</m>.
        In fact, these three different <m>g</m>'s are exactly the elements of the coset!
        The very same thing applies to all other cases.
        For example, we found <m>K(2 3) = K(1 2 3)</m>,
        and that both were equal to <m>\{(2 3), (1 2 3)\}</m>.
        This turns out to be a general property of cosets,
        which we will prove in the next section.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Unequal left and right cosets are actually very common.
    So let's get some practice determining both left and right cosets.
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Cosets_Z6_cosets">

        <m>{\mathbb Z}_6 = \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}</m> consisting of the elements 0 and 3. (We are using our simplified notation here:
        <sq>0</sq> represents <m>\overline{0}</m>, etc.) The left cosets are

  <remark>
    <p>
      From now on, if the left and right cosets coincide,
      or if it is clear from the context to which type of coset that we are referring,
      we will simply use the word
      <q>coset</q>
      without specifying left or right.
    </p>
  </remark>
  <p>
    From what we've seen so far,
    you might have noticed that it seems that left and right cosets are always equal for
    <em>abelian</em> groups.
    This makes sense,
    because abelian means you get the same result whether you compose on the left or on the right.
    In fact, it is true in general:
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Cosets_abelian_cosets">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that if <m>G</m> is an abelian group and <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>,
        then any left coset <m>gH</m> is equal to the right coset <m>Hg</m>. (*Hint*)
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    But abelian groups are not the only groups in which left cosets are equal to right cosets<ndash/>see for example the first case in <xref ref="example_Cosets_S3_Cosets">Example</xref>.
    So we still haven't answered the question of what is the most general situation in which left cosets and right cosets are equal.
    We'll take this issue up again in <xref ref="subsec_Cosets_NormalSubAndFactorGroup_NormalSubgroups">Section</xref>.
