      In <xref ref="Cryptography">Chapter</xref> we looked at cryptography,
      which is concerned with the encoding of information to make it secret.
      But coding is used for other purposes as well.
      When data is transmitted,
      it is often subject to processes which may corrupt the data and produce transmission errors.
      This situation arises in many areas of communications,
      including radio, telephone, television,
      computer communications, and even compact disc player technology.
      In order to guarantee accurate communication, the data must be encoded
      (before transmission)
      and decoded
      (after transmission)
      so that transmission errors can be detected and, if possible,
      corrected.
      As you may imagine,
      some of the world's leading high-tech companies are heavily involved in this area<ndash/>and breakthroughs can mean big bucks for the discoverers!

      <em>Prerequisites</em>: In this chapter we will make extensive use of the group <m>\mathbb{Z}^{n}_{2}</m>,
      which is the direct product of <m>n</m> copies of
      <m>\mathbb{Z}_{2}</m> (direct products were introduced in <xref ref="sec_Isomorphism_DirectProductsClassificationAbelianGroups">Section</xref>.
      The discussion of linear block codes
      (<xref ref="sec_ErrorAndCorrectionCode_BlockCodes">Section</xref> and following)
      uses concepts from linear algebra such as matrix,
      vector, and matrix multiplication.
      <xref ref="sec_ErrorAndCorrectionCode_EfficientDecoding">Section</xref>
      uses some basic ideas about cosets,
      which were introduced in <xref ref="Cosets">Chapter</xref>.
