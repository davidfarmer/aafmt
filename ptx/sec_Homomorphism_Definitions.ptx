  <title>Definition and several more examples</title>
  <p>
    In the previous section we saw that homomorphisms give us a way of finding structural similarity between groups,
    even when those groups are not isomorphic.
    A homomorphism only needs to map elements from one group to another in such a way that it preserves the operations between the two groups.
    That's it.
    Unlike isomorphisms, it doesn't have to be one-to-one or onto.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's now formally state the definition:
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        {homomorphism_def} A <term>homomorphism</term><idx><h>Group</h><h>homomorphism of</h></idx>
            <idx><h>Homomorphism</h></idx>
        between groups <m>(G, \cdot)</m> and
        <m>(H, \circ)</m> is a function <m>f : G \rightarrow H</m> such that
        <me>
          f( g_1 \cdot g_2 ) = f( g_1 ) \circ f( g_2 )
        </me>
        for all <m>g_1, g_2 \in G</m>.
        The range of <m>f</m> in <m>H</m> is called the
        <term> homomorphic image</term>
            <idx><h>Homomorphic image</h></idx>
        <nbsp/>of<nbsp/><m>f</m>.<fn>
        You may have noticed that in the Isomorphisms chapter we used Greek letters (<m>\phi</m> etc.) for isomorphisms,
        whereas here we typically use the  letter <m>f</m> to denote a homomorphism.
        There is no special reason for this<ndash/>both notations are used in math books,
        and you should be comfortable either way.

    All of our examples so far have been with finite groups;
    let's look at infinite groups instead.
    As we saw in the Isomorphisms chapter,
    with finite groups we can use Cayley tables to verify the equality of the group operations,
    but with infinite groups we don't have Cayley tables,
    so we need to use the definition of a homomorphism.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Recall that the circle group
        <m>{ \mathbb T}</m> consists of all complex numbers <m>z</m> such that <m>|z|=1</m>.
        So geometrically,
        the circle group consists of the complex numbers that trace out a circle of radius 1 about the origin in the complex plane
        (hence the name),
        as shown in the figure below:

        Now imagine wrapping the real number line around this circle like it was a tape measure,
        with <m>0</m> on the real number line corresponding to <m>1</m> on the unit circle.
        Then we would have a correspondence between each real number and a complex number in <m>{ \mathbb T}</m>.
        Every <m>2\pi</m> units the real numbers start around the circle again,
        so that an infinite set of real numbers corresponds to each complex number <m>z</m> in <m>{ \mathbb T}</m>.
        For instance not only 0, but <m>2\pi, 4\pi, 6\pi</m>,
        etc. would correspond to <m>1</m>.
        Evidently for a given complex number <m>z</m>,
        any real number <m>\alpha</m> that corresponds to <m>z</m> is an
        <em>argument</em> for <m>z</m>
        (see <xref ref="fig_polarcoord">Figure</xref>),
        so that <m>z = \cis \alpha</m>.
        From this point of view,
        we may conceive of <m>\cis</m> as a function from
        <m>{ \mathbb R}</m> to <m>{ \mathbb T}</m>.
        Does <m>\cis</m> preserve the operations between
        <m>{ \mathbb R}</m> and <m>{ \mathbb T}</m>?
        We've shown this before in <xref ref="proposition_ComplexNumbers_polar_mult">Proposition</xref>
        in the Complex Numbers chapter,
        but it won't hurt to see it again:
        <md>
          <mrow>\cis( \alpha + \beta ) \amp  = \cos( \alpha + \beta ) + i \sin( \alpha + \beta )</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = (\cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin \beta)  + i( \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta )</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = (\cos \alpha + i \sin \alpha )(\cos \beta + i \sin \beta )</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \cis( \alpha ) \cis( \beta )</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we have it;
        <m>\cis</m> is a homomorphism from the additive group of real numbers to the circle group.
        This means that in some sense,
        complex multiplication on the unit circle is like addition of real numbers.
      </p>

    In the following exercise,
    we relate the previous example to the properties observed in <xref ref="example_Homomorphism_Z_8_i_homomorph">Examples</xref>

  <example xml:id="example_Homomorphism_homo_C_">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The circle group <m>{ \mathbb T}</m> also gives us a completely different way of constructing a homomorphism between complex and real numbers.
        Every complex number in <m>{ \mathbb T}</m> has modulus 1;
        i.e. they lie all on a circle of radius 1 in the complex plane.
        If we increase radius of the circle to 2, all of those complex numbers have the same modulus 2.
        In fact if you keep increasing or decreasing the radius of the circle,
        you can catch all the complex numbers in the plane with the concentric circles you've created.
        So every complex number (except 0) corresponds to a positive real number by its modulus.
        Since we can represent any complex number as <m>r \cis \theta</m>,
        we can define a function <m>f:  {\mathbb C}^\ast \mapsto  {\mathbb R}^\ast</m> by
        <me>
          f(r \cis \theta) = r
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's see whether <m>f</m> is a homomorphism.
        If <m>r_1 \cis \theta_1</m> and
        <m>r_2 \cis \theta_2</m> are arbitrary nonzero complex numbers, we have:
        <md>
          <mrow>f((r_1\cis \theta_1)\cdot (r_2\cis \theta_2)) \amp = f(r_1 \cis \theta_1 r_2 \cis \theta_2)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = f((r_1 r_2)\cis (\theta_1+ \theta_2))</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = r_1 r_2</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = f((r_1\cis \theta_1)\cdot f(r_2\cis \theta_2))</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So <m>f</m> is indeed a homomorphism from
        <m>{\mathbb C}^\ast</m> to <m>{\mathbb R}^\ast</m>.
