  <title>Further properties of ideals and principal ideals</title>
  <p>
    We arrived at the concept of <sq>ideal</sq> by studying kernels of ring homomorphisms.
    It turns out that ideals are objects of interest in their own right,
    without any reference to homomorphisms.
    In the following,
    we will investigate some additional properties of ideals.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="example_Rings_not_ideal">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given the ring <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> and <m>J=\{0,7,14,21,\cdots\}</m>.
        Prove or disprove <m>J</m> is an ideal.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We can see that <m>J\subset {\mathbb Z}</m>,
      and <m>J</m> is closed under addition however <m>J</m> fails properties (b) and (c).

            Given a ring <m>R</m> show that every ideal in <m>R</m> is a group under the ring's additive operation.

    In <xref ref="ex_eoc_31">Exercise</xref>
    we showed that the intersection of subgroups is also a subgroup.
    It turns out the same is true for ideals:

  <proposition xml:id="proposition_Rings_int_ideal">

      <p>
        The intersection of ideals is an ideal.

    We will now look at an important class of ideals.

      <p>
        {principal_ideal} A <term>principal ideal</term>
        is an ideal that is generated by a single element.
        In other words, <m>Ra\equiv \{ra,r\in R\}</m> is a
        <term>principal ideal</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Rings_ringIsPrId">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that every ring <m>R</m> is also a principal ideal. (*Hint*)
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the ring of integers <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.
        Then <m>2Z=\{0,\displaystyle \pm 2,\displaystyle \pm 4,\cdots\}</m> is a principal ideal and is generated by <m>2</m>.
        In fact, for any integer <m>k</m>,
        the set <m>kZ=\{0,\displaystyle \pm k,\displaystyle \pm 2k,\cdots\}</m> is a principal ideal.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Not all ideals are principal ideals.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>{\mathbb Z}[x]: J\equiv \{2p(x)+xq(x),p(x),q(x)\in {\mathbb Z}[x]\}</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Show that <m>J</m> is an ideal,
        but not a principal ideal.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <md>
        <mrow>\amp \text{ \(2\in J\) and \(x\in J\) }  \amp \text{ definition of \(J\) }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \text{Suppose \(J=a{\mathbb Z}[x]\) for some \(a\in {\mathbb Z}[x]\)}  \amp  \text{ supposition }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \text{ Since \(2\in J,~a=1\) or \(a=2\) }  \amp  \text{ only elements to divide 2 }</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \text{If \(a=1\), then \(1{\mathbb Z}[x]={\mathbb Z}[x]\neq J\)}  \amp</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \text{If \(a=2\), then \(x\notin 2{\mathbb Z}[x]\). So \(2{\mathbb Z}[x]\neq J\)}  \amp  \text{ \(x\) has no even coef. }</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        Therefore, there does not exist an <m>a</m> such that <m>a\in {\mathbb Z}[x]=J</m>.
        Which means <m>J</m> is not a principal ideal by the definition of principal ideal.
      </p>
