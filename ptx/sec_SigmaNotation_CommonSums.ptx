    There are several sums, even a few infinite sums,
    for which the total value is known.
    One very basic example is:
    <me>
      \sum_{i=1}^{k}1
    </me>.
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Evaluate the preceding sum.
        Be careful-the answer is NOT 1.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    Another very useful example is:
    <me>
      \sum_{i=1}^{k}i=1+2+3\cdots+(k-1) + k
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    If one were to take the first term 1 and add it to the last term <m>k</m>,
    we get <m>k+1</m>.
    If we take the second term 2 and add to the second-to-last term <m>k-1</m> again we get <m>k+1</m>.
    This is true for all terms in between.
    In the case of an even number of terms
    (such as <m>1+2+3+4</m>),
    the terms split evenly.
    In the case of an odd number of terms
    (such as <m>1+2+3+4+5+6+7</m>)
    we have 3 pairs that add to 8 but an additional term in the middle.
    In either case,
    we take the first term add to the last term and multiply that quantity by 1/2 the number of terms.
    The formula is thus:
    <me>
      \sum_{i=1}^{k}i= \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can use the same reasoning to arrive at the following formula.
    <me>
      \sum_{i=a}^{k}i=a+(a+1)+(a+2)\cdots+(k-1) + k = (k+a)(k-a+1)/2
    </me>,
    where <m>a</m> and <m>k</m> are integers and <m>a\lt k</m>.
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_SigmaNotation_common1">
    <statement>
      <ol type="a">

            where <m>n</m> is an integer.)

    All of the sums in <xref ref="exercise_SigmaNotation_common1">Exercise</xref>
    have a constant difference between consecutive terms
    (this constant difference is also called the <em>step size</em>).
        <idx><h>Step size</h><h>for arithmetic sum</h></idx>
    The step sizes for parts (a), (c),
    and (e) are 2,2, and 5 respectively.
    Any sum with a constant step size is called an
    <term>arithmetic sum</term>:
    and all arithmetic sums can be evaluated using the same technique that was used in parts (b),(d),
    and (f) of the exercise.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Geometric sums</term> are defined as the sum of non-negative integer powers of a common base.
    For example, here is a geometric sum with base 1/2:
    <me>
      \sum_{i=0}^{n}\left({\dfrac{1}{2}}\right)^i=\left({\dfrac{1}{2}}\right)^0+\left({\dfrac{1}{2}}\right)^1+\left({\dfrac{1}{2}}\right)^2\cdots +\left({\dfrac{1}{2}}\right)^n  = 1 + {\dfrac{1}{2}} + {\dfrac{1}{4}} + {\dfrac{1}{8}}\cdots +\left({\dfrac{1}{2}}\right)^n
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We can evaluate this sum using an algebraic trick.
    Let <m>S</m> be the value of this sum.
    We can solve for <m>S</m> by multiplying <m>S</m> term-by-term by 1/2 and subtracting:
    <me>
      S=1+\frac{1}{2}+ \cdots + \frac{1}{2^n}  \text{ and } \frac{1}{2}S=\frac{1}{2}+ \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}
    </me>,
    so that
    <me>
      \left(S - \frac{1}{2}S\right) = 1 - \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solving this last equation for <m>S</m> gives:
    <me>
      S=\dfrac{1 - \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}}{1-\frac{1}{2}}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This same technique can be used to prove the formula for a great variety of geometric sums,
    as we show in the following exercise.

    Some sums can be evaluated by grouping terms together to partially cancel out.
    Two examples are:
    <me>
      1-2+3-4+\ldots -1000 = (1-2)+(3-4)+\ldots + (999-1000)  = (-1) + (-1) + \ldots + (-1) = -500
    </me>.
    <md>
      <mrow>1 - 4 + 9 -16 + 25 - 36 + \ldots +49^2 \amp =  1 + (-4+9) + (-16+25) + \ldots + (-48^2+49^2)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = 1 + 5 + 9 + \ldots + 97</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = (1 + 4\cdot 0) + (1 + 4\cdot 1) + \ldots + (1 + 4 \cdot 24)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = (1 + \ldots + 1) + 4\cdot(0 + 1 + \ldots + 24)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = 24 + 4\cdot (24+1)\frac{24}{2}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = 24 + 1200 = 1224</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In calculus you saw
    (or will see)
    sums that have an infinite number of terms,
    otherwise known as <term>infinite series</term>.
    Some examples include:
    <md>
      <mrow>e^x \amp = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{x^i}{i!} =1+\dfrac{x^1}{1!}+\dfrac{x^2}{2!}+\dfrac{x^3}{3!} \cdots</mrow>
      <mrow>\sin(x) \amp = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-1)^i x^{2i+1}}{(2i+1)!} = \dfrac{x^1}{1!}-\dfrac{x^3}{3!}+\dfrac{x^5}{5!}\cdots</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    Although we won't be talking about infinite series,
    the same summation notation that we've been using also applies to sums with an infinite number of terms.
