  <title>Symmetries of regular polyhedra</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We want to apply our new ideas to gain insight about the groups of rotational symmetries of
      <term>regular polyhedra</term><idx><h>Polyhedron</h><h>regular</h></idx> In general,
      a <em>polyhedron</em> can be thought of as a collection of faces,
      edges and vertices:
      for example, a cube has 6 faces, 12 edges and 8 vertices.
      A <em>regular polyhedron</em> is a polyhedron in which all faces are congruent regular polygons,
      and the same number of edges meet at every vertex.
      The group of rotational symmetries of a polyhedron act on the faces,
      edges and vertices.
      Any rotational symmetry will always take faces to faces,
      edges to edges and vertices to vertices.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following discussion we'll be introducing a bunch of new ideas.
      As usual, we'll illustrate these ideas first on a particular example.
      So let's begin with the cube,
      which is perhaps the regular polyhedron which is easiest to understand.

    <p>
      Some of the rotational symmetries of the cube are indicated in <xref ref="fig_CubeRot">Figure</xref>.<fn>
      Note that these are NOT the only rotational symmetries of the cube<ndash/>we'll discuss the others later
      (see this excellent video: \url{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBg4-lJ19Gg}).
      </fn> The figure shows three possible rotation axes.
      We will denote the <m>90^{\circ}</m> counterclockwise rotations around the <m>x,y</m> and <m>z</m> axes as <m>r_x, r_y,r_z</m> respectively.
      We will also denote the faces of the cube as <m>x_-, x_+,y_-,y_+,z_-,z_+</m>.
      For example the rotation <m>r_x\compose r_x=r_x^2</m> will take the bottom face (<m>z_-</m>) to the top face
      (<m>z_+</m>).
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        When we rotate the cube,
        the axes remain <em>fixed</em> while the cube rotates around them.
        So in <xref ref="fig_CubeRot">Figure</xref>
        you may imagine the axes to be like
        <q>laser beams</q>
        going through the cube, where the laser beams are labeled
        <m>x,
        y</m> and <m>z</m> according to their axes.
        These laser beams and labels do not move when the figure is rotated.
        For example,
        consider the rotation <m>r_z</m> followed by <m>r_x</m>
        (which is written as <m>r_x\circ r_z</m>).
        Under <m>r_z</m>,
        the face <m>x_+</m> will rotate where the <m>y_+</m> face was.
        Then following rotation <m>r_x</m> will occur around the original laser beam <m>x</m> axis,
        and not the axis to where the <m>x_+</m> face has moved
        (which would be the rotation <m>r_y</m>).
        The cube ends up with the face <m>x_+</m> on the top with the <m>z</m> axis,
        <m>y_+</m> on the negative side of the <m>x</m> axis,
        and <m>z_+</m> on the negative side of the <m>y</m> axis.

        Make or find a physical manipulative of a cube.
        This can be a 6-sided die or constructed from paper as seen in <xref ref="fig_CubeFold">Figure</xref>.
        When working with a manipulative of your polyhedron it is a good idea label each face uniquely,
        whether by color, letter, number, or symbol.
        If you label your faces <m>x_+, x_-, y_+</m>,
        etc., make sure to remember that these refer to
        <em>faces</em> and not <em>axes</em>
        (as we said above,
        the axes are like fixed laser beams that don't move with the cube).
        It also helps to take a picture or two of your manipulative when in its starting position.
        You might also draw a pair of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes on a spare sheet of paper,
        set this on the table, and rotate your cube above this paper.

              Let's define a notation for the cube's vertices as follows.

              The edge <m>\overline{x_+,y_-}</m> is where the faces <m>x_+</m> and <m>y_-</m> meet.

      From the previous exercise it's pretty clear that for any two faces of a cube there is at least one symmetry that takes the first face to the second.
      In other words,
      if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> represent faces then there always exists a symmetry <m>g</m> such that <m>gA=B</m>.
      This example motivates the following definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {GEquivalent} If a group <m>G</m> acts on a set <m>X</m> and <m>x,
          y \in X</m>,
          then <m>x</m> is said to be <term><m>G</m>-equivalent</term><idx><h>G-equiv@<m>G</m>-equivalent</h></idx> to <m>y</m> if there exists a <m>g \in G</m> such that <m>g.x =y</m>.
          We write <m>x \sim_Gy</m> or
          <m>x \sim y</m> if two elements are <m>G</m>-equivalent.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      By this definition we can say that all faces of a cube are <m>G</m>-equivalent to each other under the group of rotational symmetries of a cube,
      because given any two faces we can always find a rotation that takes the first face to the second face
      (and the inverse rotation takes the second face back to the first face).
      The notation we're using strongly suggests that <m>\sim_G</m> must be an equivalence relation.
      If fact this is true:
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> be a <m>G</m>-set.
          Then <m>G</m>-equivalence is an equivalence relation on <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The relation <m>\sim</m> is reflexive since <m>ex = x</m>.
        Suppose that <m>x \sim y</m> for <m>x, y \in X</m>.
        Then there exists a <m>g</m> such that <m>g.x = y</m>.
        In this case <m>g^{-1}.y=x</m>;
        hence, <m>y \sim x</m>.
        To show that the relation is transitive,
        suppose that <m>x \sim y</m> and <m>y \sim z</m>.
        Then, there must exist group elements <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> such that <m>g.x = y</m> and <m>h.y= z</m>.
        So <m>z = h.y = (hg).x</m>, and <m>x</m> is equivalent to <m>z</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Recall from <xref ref="EquivalenceRelations">Chapter</xref>
      that every equivalence relation on a set <m>X</m> is associated with a partition of <m>X</m>,
      where a partition is a collection of disjoint subsets whose union is <m>X</m>.
      Each set in this partition is called an
      <term>equivalence class</term>.

          Consider the edge <m>\overline{y_+,z_+}</m> of a cube.

      In the case of a cube where <m>X=\{\text{ faces } \}\cup\{\text{ edges } \}\cup\{\text{ vertices } \}</m> The three sets
      <m>\{\text{ faces } \},\{\text{ edges } \},\{\text{ vertices } \}</m> are disjoint equivalence classes whose union is <m>X</m>.
      We call each of these sets an <em>orbit</em>
      of <m>X</m> under <m>G</m>.
      In general, we have the following definition.

    <title>Stabilizers, stabilizer subgroups, and fixed point sets</title>
    <p>
      Let's return to the cube to illustrate another new concept.
      Every rotation of a cube has an axis of rotation as well as an angle.
      For rotations which are symmetries we've considered 3 possible axes,
      passing through opposite pairs of faces.
      Take for instance the axis which passes through <m>x_+</m> and <m>x_-</m>,
      and consider the set of all the rotational symmetries having this axis.
      In fact, this set of symmetries forms a subgroup of the symmetries of the cube (in this case,
      the subgroup is isomorphic to the rotations of the square or (<m>\integer_4</m>,+)).
      Now all of the elements of this subgroup leave the face <m>x_+</m> fixed
      (although <m>x_+</m> rotates,
      it remains in the same place).
      Similarly, the rotations about the axis through <m>y_+</m> and <m>y_-</m> form a subgroup whose elements leave <m>y_+</m> fixed;
      and the rotations about the axis through <m>z_+</m> and <m>z_-</m> behave the same way for <m>z_+</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are all examples of <em>stabilizer subgroups</em>.
      The general definition is as follows.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {StabilizerSubgroups} Given that <m>X</m> is a <m>G</m>-set and <m>x \in X</m>,

          in other words, <m>g.x=x</m>.

      talks about elements of the group <m>G</m> which leave a particular element of set <m>X</m> fixed.
      We can turn this around and consider elements of <m>X</m> which are fixed by a particular element of <m>G</m>.
      In fact, each element of <m>G</m> has an associated subset of <m>X</m> that it leaves unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider for instance the group of rotations of a cube.
      We may describe the cube as consisting of faces, edges,
      and vertices.
      So let's take <m>X=\{\text{ faces } \}\cup\{\text{ edges } \}\cup\{\text{ vertices } \}</m>.
      Rotations about the <m>x</m> axis
      (which can all be expressed as <m>{r_x}^n</m> for some <m>n</m>)
      leave the faces <m>x_+</m> and <m>x_-</m> fixed.
      Similarly, <m>\{y_+</m> ,<m>y_-\}</m> and
      <m>\{z_+,z_-\}</m> are fixed by rotations about the <m>y</m> axis and <m>z</m> axis,
      respectively.
      Thus, <m>\{x_+,x_-\},\{y_+,y_-\},\{z_+,z_-\}</m>,
      are all examples of <em>fixed point sets</em> in <m>X</m>.
      This leads to another definition:

    <title>Counting formula for the order of  polyhedral rotational symmetry groups</title>
    <p>
      It is possible to characterize the size of the rotational symmetry group <m>G</m> for a regular polyhedron in terms of <m>|{\cal O}_x|</m>and <m>|G_x|</m>.
      We'll show this with an example.

    <example xml:id="example_GroupActions_CountingFormula1">

        <p>
          Consider our old friend the group of rotational symmetries of a cube acting on <m>X=\{\text{ faces } \}\cup\{\text{ edges } \}\cup\{\text{ vertices } \}</m>.
          We've seen that <m>G_{x_+}=\{\var{id},r_x,r_x^2,r_x^3\}</m> is the stabilizer subgroup for <m>x_+</m>.
          Thus there are four rotations that take <m>x_+</m> to itself.
          We've also seen that there's at least one rotation that takes <m>x_+</m> to each of the six faces of the cube:
          this is the same thing as saying that the orbit of a face is the set of all faces.
          Each of these rotations can be composed with any of the elements of <m>G_{x_+}</m> for a total of
          <m>6\cdot 4=24</m> rotational symmetries of a cube.
          To summarize, we've discovered that
          <me>
            |G|=|G_{x_+}|\cdot |{\cal O}_{x_+}|
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <m>x_+</m> was an arbitrary choice:
          we could use this argument with any of the faces and obtain the same result.

      In the previous example we used faces to count the rotational symmetries of a cube but we could use edges or vertices as well.

    <proof>
      <p>
        In general, a good way to show that two sets are the same size is to show that there is a <em>bijection</em>
        (1-1 and onto map) between the two sets.
        We will define a map <m>\phi</m> between the orbit
        <m>{\cal O}_x</m> and the set of left cosets of <m>G_x</m> in <m>G</m> as follows.
        Let <m>y \in {\cal O}_x</m>.
        Then there exists a <m>g</m> in <m>G</m> such that <m>g x = y</m>.
        Define <m>\phi</m> by <m>\phi( y ) = g G_x</m>.
        Note that this coset contain an element <m>ge=g</m>:
        so it contains an element that takes <m>x\rightarrow y</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we can show that <m>\phi</m> is a bijection,
        we must first show that <m>\phi(y)</m> is well-defined for any <m>y</m>,
        and does not depend on our selection of <m>g</m>.
        Suppose that <m>g'</m> is another element in <m>G</m> such that <m>g'x = y</m>.
        Then <m>g x = g' x</m> or <m>x= g^{-1} g' x</m>.
        By the definition of the stabilizer subgroup <m>G_x</m>,
        <m>g^{-1}g'\in G_x</m>.
        By <xref ref="proposition_Cosets_cosets_theorem_1">Proposition</xref>
        in <xref ref="sec_Cosets_CosetsPartitions">Section</xref>,
        it follows that <m>g G_x = g' G_x</m>.
        Thus, <m>y</m> gets mapped to the same coset regardless of the choice of group element.
      </p>
      <p>
        To show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one,
        we'll assume that <m>\phi(x_1) = \phi(x_2)</m>,
        and show that this means that <m>x_1=x_2</m>.
        Here we go:
      </p>
      <p>
        Recall that <m>\phi(x_1)</m> is defined as a coset of <m>G_x</m> that contains an element <m>g_1</m> that satisfies <m>g_1x=x_1</m>.
        Similarly, <m>\phi(x_2)</m> , contains an element <m>g_2</m> that satisfies <m>g_2x=x_2</m>.
        But we're assuming that <m>\phi(x_1) = \phi(x_2)</m>.
        This means that <m>g_1</m> and <m>g_2</m> are in the same coset of <m>G_x</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now consider the expression <m>g_1(g_1^{-1}g_2)x</m>.
        On the one hand, by the associative law we get:
        <me>
          (g_1g_1^{-1})g_2x=g_2x=x_2
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand,
        by <xref ref="proposition_Cosets_cosets_theorem_1">Proposition</xref> in the Cosets chapter,
        it follows that <m>g_1^{-1}g_2</m> is in <m>G_x</m>,
        so that <m>g_1^{-1}g_2x=x</m>.
        This means that we also have:
        <me>
          g_1(g_1^{-1}g_2)x=g_1x=x_1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore <m>x_1=x_2</m>.
        This completes the proof that <m>\phi</m> is 1-1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we must show that the map <m>\phi</m> is onto:
        that is, every coset of <m>G_x</m> is in the range of <m>\phi</m>.
        This is much quicker than the proof of 1-1.
        Let <m>g G_x</m> be any left coset.
        If <m>g x =y</m>, then <m>\phi(y) = g G_x</m>.
        Thus <m>gG_x</m> is in the range of <m>\phi</m>,
        and the proof is finished.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec_GroupActions_SymmetryOfPolyhedra_RepresentSymmetryGroupAsStabilizer">
    <title>Representing a symmetry group in terms of stabilizer subgroups</title>
    <p>
      We can approach the structure of the group of rotational symmetries of a cube from another direction.
      We've talked about stabilizer subgroups,
      and we can see how these subgroups
      <q>fit together</q>
      within <m>G</m>.
      For example,
      we've seen that for every face there are three rotations
      (besides the identity)
      that leaves that face fixed.
      These rotations correspond to 90, 180,
      and 270 degree rotations of a square:
      so they have order 4,2, and 4 respectively.<fn>
      Recall that the
      <q>order</q>
      of a group element <m>g</m> is the smallest positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>g^n = \var{id}</m>.
      </fn> So for each face,
      there are two rotations of order 4 and one rotation of order 2 in the stabilizer of that face.
      Since there are 6 faces of a cube,
      this seems to imply that there must be twelve rotations of order 4 and six rotations of order 2 associated with the stabilizers of the different faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this is not quite true.
      The reason is that any rotation that leaves the front face fixed also leaves the back face fixed.
      So the stabilizer of the front face is the same as the stabilizer of the back face.
      In fact, the faces of the cube are stabilized in pairs:
      front-back, left-right, and top-bottom.
      Since there are 3 pairs,
      this means that we only have 6 rotations of order 4 and 3 rotations of order 2.
      If we add in the identity, this gives a total of 10 rotations.
      But we've already shown that the group of rotational symmetries of a cube has 24 elements.
      So where are the other 14?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we haven't exhausted the possible stabilizers.
      Consider for instance the stabilizer of a vertex.
      We know that 3 faces meet at each vertex.
      So if I twirl the cube around the vertex,
      the three faces can rotate into each other.
      So besides the identity, there are two rotations of order 3.
      As with the faces,
      each vertex has a corresponding opposite vertex<ndash/>so the vertices are stabilized in pairs.
      Since there are 8 vertices,
      this means there are 4 pairs,
      which means there are 8 rotations of order 3.
      This brings us up to a total of 18 rotations.
      So where are the other six?

      <p>
        Consider a regular tetrahedron,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_TetRot">Figure</xref>.
        This polyhedron has 4 faces, 6 edges and 4 vertices.
        Each face is a triangle and each face is opposite a vertex.
        We will consider the rotations of a tetrahedron around 4 axes.
        Each axis passes through a vertex and the face opposite that vertex.
        See <xref ref="fig_TetRot">Figure</xref>.
        For example,
        a rotation of the axis through vertex <m>A</m> will also stabilize face <m>a</m>.
        We can call this axis <m>\overset{\leftrightarrow}{Aa}</m>.
        Similarly, we will call the other axes <m>\overset{\leftrightarrow}{Bb}</m>,
        <m>\overset{\leftrightarrow}{Cc}</m> and <m>\overset{\leftrightarrow}{Dd}</m>.

      </figure>
      <p>
        Each of these axes rotates a triangular face.
        We'll write one counterclockwise rotation of face <m>a</m> around <m>\overset{\leftrightarrow}{Aa}</m> as <m>r_{Aa}</m>
        (and similarly for the other axes).

      <title>The octahedron</title>
      <p>
        Another regular polyhedron is the octahedron.
        We will see that in some ways an octahedron is like a cube.
        When opposite points are lined up on a vertical <m>z</m> axis,
        the octahedron has no vertical or horizontal faces,
        as shown in <xref ref="fig_OctaRot">Figure</xref>.
        We denote a <m>90^{\circ}</m> counterclockwise rotation around the <m>z</m> axis by <m>r_z</m>
        (and similarly for rotations around the <m>x</m>, and <m>y</m> axes).
        Since each vertex of the octahedron lies on an axis,
        we can use the <m>x,y</m>, and <m>z</m> axis to label the vertices.
        For example <m>y_+</m> is the vertex on the positive <m>y</m> axis.
        We can also name the edges using this notation for their endpoints.
        Let's use the axes to label the faces of the octahedron too.
        Consider <xref ref="fig_OctaRot">Figure</xref>,
        we'll refer to the the face in the first octant as <m>\triangle_{ +++}</m>
        (the other faces will be labeled similarly).

      <title>The dodecahedron</title>
      <p>
        Let's practice finding the elements of the rotation group of another regular polyhedron.
        Consider the regular dodecahedron in <xref ref="fig_Dodeca">Figure</xref>.
        A dodecahedron has 12 faces and each face is a regular pentagon.
        How many edges does this polyhedron have and how many vertices?
        Well, since each of the twelve faces is a pentagon that seems to give <m>12\cdot 5=60</m> edges.
        But two faces meet at each edge,
        so we actually have <m>(12\cdot 5)/2=30</m> edges.

      Now in <xref ref="exercise_GroupActions_Stabilizers2">Exercises</xref>,
      <xref ref="exercise_GroupActions_Tetra9"></xref>,
      and <xref ref="exercise_GroupActions_Octa10"></xref>
      we showed another way of counting the elements of <m>G</m>:
      by counting the stabilizers of faces, vertices, and edges
      (plus the identity).
      But does this work for <em>every</em> polyhedron?
      Could there possibly be a rotational symmetry that doesn't stabilize <em>anything</em>?
      It turns out that this isn't possible
      (at least in three dimensions).
      The argument
      (which depends on a key fact proved by the famous mathematician Leonhard Euler)
      goes as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Euler proved in 1775 that any rotation in three dimensions has a unique fixed axis.
      (We won't give the proof here,
      but it's related to the cross product discussed in <xref ref="subsec_SigmaApp_LeviCivitaAndApp_LeviCivita">Section</xref>.)
      Now if we rotate a polyhedron,
      then the axis must intersect the polyhedron twice:
      that is, it must intersect two elements of <m>X</m> where <m>X = \{\text{ faces,
      vertices,
      edges } \}</m>.
      Let's call these two elements
      <m>\epsilon_1</m> and <m>\epsilon_2</m>.
      Since the rotation leaves the two intersections unchanged,
      there's one point of <m>\epsilon_1</m> which maps to itself
      (and similarly for <m>\epsilon_2</m>).
      If the rotation is a symmetry,
      then <m>\epsilon_1</m> must be fixed by the rotation,
      because there's no way it couldn't map to a different element of <m>X</m> and still have one point which remains in <m>\epsilon_1</m>.
      The same argument holds for <m>\epsilon_2</m>.
      This shows that any rotational symmetry must stabilize at least two elements of <m>X</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can take the argument even further.
      The rotational symmetry which stabilizes <m>\epsilon_1</m> and
      <m>\epsilon_2</m> can't possibly stabilize any other elements of <m>X</m>:
      this is because the center point of any stabilized element
      (be it face, vertex, or edge)
      is unchanged by a rotational symmetry,
      and Euler tells us that there is only one fixed axis and hence exactly two fixed points.
    </p>
    <p>
      So since every rotational symmetry
      (besides the identity)
      stabilizes <em>exactly</em> two elements,
      then if we sum up all of the (non-identity) stabilizers for all elements of <m>X</m> then we will count each (non-identity) symmetry exactly twice.
      It follows that
      <me>
        2(|G|-1) = \sum_{x \in X}  (|G_x|-1)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      (note that we use <m>|G|-1</m> and <m>|G_x|-1</m> because we're not counting the identity symmetry).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's apply this formula to a regular polyhedron with <m>|{\cal O}_f|</m> faces,
      <m>|{\cal O}_v|</m> vertices and <m>|{\cal O}_e|</m> edges.
      Applying <xref ref="proposition_GroupActions_OrbStab">Proposition</xref> to faces,
      edges, and vertices gives:
      <me>
        |G_f|=\frac{|G|}{|{\cal O}_f|}; \qquad |G_e|=\frac{|G|}{|{\cal O}_e|}; \qquad |G_v|=\frac{|G|}{|{\cal O}_v|}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for the sum.
      Since there are <m>{\cal O}_f</m> faces,
      <m>{\cal O}_e</m> edges, and <m>{\cal O}_v</m> vertices we have:
      <md>
        <mrow>2 (|G| -1) \amp =  \sum_{x \in X}  (|G_x|-1)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =  \sum_{\text{ faces } }  (|G_f|-1)+\sum_{\text{ edges } }  (|G_e|-1)+\sum_{\text{ vertices } }  (|G_v|-1)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = |{\cal O}_f|  \left(\frac{|G|}{|{\cal O}_f|}-1\right)+ |{\cal O}_e| \left(\frac{|G|}{|{\cal O}_e|}-1\right)+  |{\cal O}_v|\left(\frac{|G|}{|{\cal O}_v|}-1\right)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =  3|G| - |{\cal O}_f| -  |{\cal O}_e| -  |{\cal O}_v|</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rearranging, we find:
      <me>
        |{\cal O}_f| +  |{\cal O}_v|  +  |{\cal O}_e| =  |G|+2
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we've also seen that <m>|G| = 2{\cal O}_e</m> for regular polyhedra.
      Substituting and rearranging a little further gives:
      <me>
        |{\cal O}_f|+|{\cal O}_v|-|{\cal O}_e|=2
      </me>.

        Euler's formula has far more general application than we've shown here.
        It works for any network of edges and vertices which can be drawn on a sphere.
        Variants of the formula work for networks drawn on other shapes
        (like a donut, or a donut with multiple holes).

      Take a moment to appreciate how amazing these results are.
      Since polyhedra are geometrical objects,
      one would think that one would have to consider geometrical facts about angles and how they fit together in order to determine which ones are possible.
      In particular,
      we know from geometry that a regular polyhedron couldn't have more than 6 regular polygons meeting at an edge,
      because then we'd have more than 360 degrees.
      Geometry also tells us that polyhedral faces couldn't have more than 6 sides,
      since then we couldn't have more than 2 meeting at a vertex.
      But we have figured out which regular polyhedra can exist,
      purely on the basis of algebra with no considerations of angles whatsoever!
    </p>
    <p>
      The other wonderfully mysterious fact is that all of the regular polyhedra that we have determined to be possible do actually exist.
      It seems that our simple algebraic representations have captured some deep properties of the three-dimensional world that we live in.

    <title>Reflection symmetries of polyhedra</title>
    <p>
      We have never shown that the rotational symmetries are the <em>only</em>
      symmetries of the regular solids In fact, there are others!
      Recall that in the dihedral group,
      besides rotations there were reflections.
      Consider for example the hexagon:
      it had 6 rotations
      (including the identity)
      and 6 reflections.
      It's possible to rotate the hexagon and keep the hexagon in the same plane.
      However, to reflect the hexagon, you have to
      <q>flip</q>
      it, which requires three dimensions.
      It turns out that something similar is true for the regular solids.
      There are also reflection symmetries for the regular solids:
      in fact, there are as many reflections as rotations,
      just as in the dihedral group.
      Also like the dihedral group,
      to reflect a solid requires one extra dimension.
      It is rather mind-blowing to think that if we lived in a world with four physical dimensions,
      it would be possible to turn your right hand into your left hand just by

      The set of all possible rotations in 3 dimensions forms a group,

      (<m>SO_3</m> is actually the intersection of the

      In <xref ref="Symmetry">Chapter</xref>
      we encountered another class of finite subgroups of <m>SO_3</m>,

      (we should be careful to include <m>D_2</m>,
      which is generated by a single 180-degree rotation and a flip).
      Although a flip is not a 2-d rotation,
      it is a rotation in 3-dimensions
      (as we indicated in <xref ref="subsec_GroupActions_SymmetryOfPolyhedra_reflSym">Section</xref>).
      Naturally, the rotation groups for the different <m>n</m>-gons (which are subgroups of the <m>D_n</m> form another class of finite subgroups of <m>SO_3</m>.
