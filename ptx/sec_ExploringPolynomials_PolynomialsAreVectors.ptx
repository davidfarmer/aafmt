  <title>Polynomials are also vectors</title>
  <p>
    At this point the
    <q>abstract</q>
    of abstract algebra comes into play.
    Once we have defined vector space,
    then <em>any</em> set of any objects that satisfies all ten requirements qualifies as a bona fide vector space,
    and objects in the set can be called vectors.
    Do polynomials qualify?
    We already know that we can add polynomials together,
    and we can also multiply polynomials by scalars.
    To see whether or not the set of polynomials with real coefficients
    (that is, <m>\RR[x]</m>)
    is a vector space, we will need to check all 10 conditions:
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>p(x)</m>, <m>q(x)</m>,
        and <m>r(x)</m> be polynomials in <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m>,
        and let <m>\alpha</m>, <m>\beta\in\mathbb{R}</m> be scalars.
        Write the 10 conditions in terms of <m>p(x)</m>,
        <m>q(x)</m>, <m>r(x)</m>, <m>\alpha</m>, <m>\beta</m>.
        For example, we have:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. (Closure under +) <m>p(x)+q(x)</m> is in the set <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. (Additive inverse) <m>p(x)+(-1)\cdot p(x)=0</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        8. <m>\alpha(p(x)+q(x))=\alpha p(x)+\alpha q(x)</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        To complete the exercise, write conditions 2,3,4,6,7,9,10.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use summation notation to prove properties 5,7,8 for polynomials.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>

    The preceding exercises show that the set
    <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m> over <m>\mathbb{R}</m> is a vector space,
    using the standard operations on polynomials.
    In fact, the polynomial ring <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m> is an
    <term>infinite-dimensional</term> vector space.
        <idx><h>Vector space</h><h>inifinite dimensional</h></idx>
    It's true that each individual polynomial has finite degree,
    but the set has no single bound on the degree of all of its members.
    For instance, We can think of
    <m>1 + 4x + 7x^2</m> as corresponding to the vector <m>( 1, 4, 7, 0, 0,...)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another vector space that we will want to examine is the set of
    <m>n \times n</m> matrices with real entries.
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>M</m> be the set of
        <m>n \times n</m> matrices with real entries.
        Let <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> be elements of <m>M</m>,
        and let <m>\alpha</m>, <m>\beta\in\mathbb{R}</m> be scalars.
        Write the 10 vector space conditions in terms of <m>A,B,C,\alpha,\beta</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
