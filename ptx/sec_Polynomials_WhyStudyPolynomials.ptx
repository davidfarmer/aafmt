  <title>Why study polynomials?</title>
  <p>
    Undoubtedly you've seen polynomials quite a bit in high school math.
    You've added and multiplied them; you've graphed them;
    you've factored them; you've found roots.
    Let's take a moment to remind ourselves why polynomials and their operations are important.
  </p>
  <p>
    Polynomials are used to express relationships between variables.
    For example,
    we may consider the situation of a vehicle that is moving on a straight road.
    We'll use <m>x</m> to denote the position,
    and <m>t</m> to denote time.
    If (for example) the vehicle has an initial displacement of 100 meters,
    initial velocity equal to 40 m/sec,
    and constant acceleration <m>-5</m> <m>\text{ m/sec } ^2</m>,
    then we may write the following relationship between position (<m>x</m>) and time (<m>t</m>):
    <me>
      x =  -\frac{5}{2} t^2+ 40t + 100
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    (the factor of <m>-\frac{5}{2}</m> in the <m>t^2</m> term comes from calculus).
    In this equation,
    we have expressed <m>x</m> as a function of <m>t</m>:
    in other words, <m>t</m> is the
    <term>independent variable</term>,
    and <m>x</m> is the <term>dependent variable</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now suppose a second vehicle is moving along the same road in the opposite direction.
    We'll represent this vehicle's position as <m>y</m>,
    and suppose that <m>y</m> depends on <m>t</m> as follows:
    <me>
      y =   t^2- 30t + 600
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we're interested in the position of the second vehicle relative to the first,
    then we should take <m>y - x</m>,
    which we can also write as <m>y + (-1)x</m>:
    <me>
      y + (-1)x =  (t^2- 30t + 600) + (-1)(-\frac{5}{2} t^2+ 40t + 100)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This equation illustrates two operations with polynomials,
    namely <em>scalar multiplication</em><idx><h>Polynomial</h><h>scalar multiplication of</h></idx>
        <idx><h>scalar multiplication</h><h>of polynomials</h></idx>
    and <em>polynomial addition</em>.
        <idx><h>Polynomial</h><h>addition</h></idx>
    Naturally we may perform the operations and obtain:
    <me>
      y -x =  \frac{7}{2} t^2- 70t + 500
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we are interested in the time(s) at which the two vehicles meet
    (hopefully without colliding!),
    then we need to find the solution(s) (also known as the
    <em>roots</em><idx><h>roots</h><h>of polynomial</h></idx>
        <idx><h>Polynomial</h><h>roots</h></idx>
    of <m>y-x = 0</m>, or
    <me>
      \frac{7}{2} t^2 - 70t + 500 = 0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is interesting to note that even though the coefficients of this polynomial are rational numbers,
    in general the solution(s) will not be rational numbers. (In fact,
    we know from the quadratic formula that in some cases the solutions are not even real numbers!)
  </p>
  <p>
    Now suppose instead that the two vehicles are moving on two perpendicular roads which cross at <m>(0,0)</m>.
    In this case,
    the square of the distance between the two vehicles is given by (using the Pythagorean theorem)
    <md>
      <mrow>(\text{ Distance between vehicles } )^2 \amp = x^2 + y^2</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = (-\frac{5}{2} t^2+ 40t + 100)^2 + (t^2- 30t + 600)^2</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here we see both polynomial addition and
    <em>polynomial multiplication</em>.
    Using polynomial arithmetic
    (which we explain in detail in the next section),
    we find:
    <md>
      <mrow>(\text{ Distance between vehicles } )^2 = \frac{29}{4}t^4 - 260t^3+3200t^2-28,000t+370000</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we would like to find the time(s) at which the relative distance is equal to 500, we should solve
    <me>
      500^2 = \frac{29}{4}t^4 - 260t^3+3200t^2-28,000t+370000
    </me>,
    which can be rearranged to give
    <me>
      \frac{29}{4}t^4 - 260t^3+3200t^2-28,000t+120000=0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This equation has two real solutions and two complex solutions.
    (In <xref ref="subsec_Polynomials_PolynomialsAndDivision_FTOA">Section</xref>
    we will see that a polynomial of degree four always has at least 1 and at most 4 distinct complex roots.)
    The real solutions correspond to the two times that the cars are 500 meters apart.

    The above discussion gives just one example of an application of polynomials to a practical situation.
    There are myriads of other examples where polynomials describe the behavior of real-world systems,
    and polynomial operations and equations are used to make useful predictions and estimations.
