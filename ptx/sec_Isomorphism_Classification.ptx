  <title>Classification up to isomorphism</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have been emphasizing that two groups that are isomorphic are the
      <q>same</q>
      as far as all group properties are concerned.
      So if we can characterize a class of groups as isomorphic to a well-understood set of groups,
      then all of the properties of the well-understood groups carry over to the entire class of groups.
      We will see two examples of this in the following subsections.

    <title>Classifying cyclic groups</title>
    <p>
      Our first classification result concerns cyclic groups.

    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Isomorphism_isomorph_theorem_2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>G</m> is a cyclic group of infinite order,
          then <m>G</m> is isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a cyclic group with infinite order and suppose that <m>a</m> is a generator of <m>G</m>.
        Define a map <m>\phi : {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow  G</m> by <m>\phi : n \mapsto a^n</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          \phi( m+n ) = a^{m+n} = a^m a^n = \phi( m ) \phi( n )
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one,
        suppose that <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are two elements in
        <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>, where <m>m \neq n</m>.
        We can assume that <m>m > n</m>.
        We must show that <m>a^m \neq a^n</m>.
        Let us suppose the contrary;
        that is, <m>a^m = a^n</m>.
        In this case <m>a^{m - n} = e</m>, where <m>m - n>0</m>,
        which contradicts the fact that <m>a</m> has infinite order.
        Our map is onto since any element in <m>G</m> can be written as <m>a^n</m> for some integer <m>n</m> and <m>\phi(n) = a^n</m>.

    <title>Characterizing all groups: Cayley's theorem</title>
    <p>
      In the previous section, we saw that any cyclic group is
      <q>equivalent</q>
      (in the sense of isomorphism) to one of the groups <m>\mathbb{Z}_n</m>.
      This enables us to easily conceptualize any cyclic group in terms of a standardized set of groups that we're very familiar with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, can we do something similar with <em>all</em> groups?
      In other words,
      can we find a standardized set of groups so that any group can be characterized as equivalent
      (up to isomorphism)
      to one of these standard groups?.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a way we already have a standardized characterization of finite groups,
      because we have seen that every finite group can be represented with a Cayley table.
      But this is not really satisfactory,
      because there are many Cayley tables which do not correspond to any group.

      Although Cayley tables are not adequate for our purpose,

      Consider first the following simple example.

    <example xml:id="example_Isomorphism_cayley_isomorph">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Cayley table for <m>{\mathbb Z}_3</m> is

        <p>
          The addition table of <m>{\mathbb Z}_3</m> suggests that it is the isomorphic to the permutation group <m>\{ \var{id}, (0 1 2), (0 2 1) \}</m>.
          One possible isomorphism is
          <md>
            <mrow>0 \amp  \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 \amp  1 \amp  2</mrow>
            <mrow>0 \amp  1 \amp  2 \end{pmatrix} = \var{id}</mrow>

        </p>
        <p>
          Notice the interesting
          <q>coincidence</q>
          that the rows of the Cayley table (
          <m>(0~1~2), (1~2~0)</m> and <m>2~1~0)</m> respectively)
          <q>just happen</q>
          to agree exactly with the second rows of the three tableaus!
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, this
          <q>coincidence</q>
          is no accident.
          For example,
          the second row of the Cayley table is obtained as <m>(1\oplus 0~~1\oplus 1~~1\oplus 2)</m>,
          and the permutation <m>\begin{pmatrix}0 \amp 1 \amp 2 \\ 1 \amp 2 \amp 0 \end{pmatrix}</m> that is the isomorphic image of 1 is actually the function from
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_3 \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}_3</m> that takes <m>n</m> to <m>1 \oplus n</m>.

    <p>
      In <xref ref="example_Isomorphism_cayley_isomorph">Example</xref>
      it was fairly easy to obtain permutations directly from the Cayley table,

      But what if the group has different elements?
      No problem<ndash/>we can just relabel the elements,

      can be generalized to any finite group of any size,
      whether abelian or nonabelian:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Isomorphism_isomorph_theorem_6">
      <statement>
        <p>
          (<em>Cayley's theorem</em>)
              <idx><h>Cayley's Theorem</h></idx>
          Every finite group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>G</m> be a group with <m>|G|</m> elements.
        We seek a group of permutations
        <m>P \subset S_{|G|}</m> that is isomorphic to <m>G</m>.
        For any <m>g \in G</m> we may define a function <m>\phi_g : G \rightarrow G</m> by
        <me>
          \phi_g(a) := ga
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We claim that <m>\phi_g</m> is a permutation on <m>G</m>:
        you will show this in <xref ref="exercise_Isomorphism_finish_proof">Exercise</xref> below.
        Let us define the set <m>P\subset S_{|G|}</m> as
        <me>
          P = \{ \phi_g : g \in G \}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us now define a function
        <m>\Phi: G \rightarrow P</m> just as we did in <xref ref="example_Isomorphism_cayley_isomorph">Example</xref>:
        <me>
          \Phi(g) := \phi_g
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's pause for a minute here,
        to make sure that you understand what's going on.
        According to the definition,
        <m>\Phi</m> is a function whose domain is the group <m>G</m> and whose range is a subset of the permutation group on <m>|G|</m> letters.
        Now permutations are functions in their own right:
        so <m>\Phi</m> is a function
        (from <m>G</m> to <m>P</m>),
        and for each <m>g \in G</m>, <m>\Phi(g)</m> is
        <em>also</em> a function
        (from <m>G</m> to <m>G</m>).
        We could say that <m>\Phi</m> is a function-valued function. (This can be quite unnerving the first time you see it <mdash/> but such constructions are common in higher mathematics,
        so it's best to get used to them!) In this case,
        you should understand that <m>\Phi(g)</m> is a permutation,
        and <m>\Phi(g) (a)</m> is the permutation <m>\Phi(g)</m> applied to the group element <m>a</m>.
        According to the definition of <m>\Phi(g)</m>,
        <m>\Phi(g) (a)</m> is equal to <m>\phi_g(a)</m>,
        which by the definition of <m>\phi_g</m> is equal to <m>ga</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, now let's get back to the argument.
        To show that <m>\Phi</m> is an isomorphism,
        we must show that <m>\Phi</m> is one-to-one, onto,
        and preserves the group operation.
        You will show that <m>\Phi</m> is one-to-one and onto in <xref ref="exercise_Isomorphism_finish_proof">Exercise</xref> below.
        To show that <m>\Phi</m> preserves the group operation,
        we need to show that <m>\Phi(gh) = \Phi(g) \circ \Phi(h)</m> for any elements <m>g,
        h \in G</m>.
        We may show this element-by-element:
        that is, we show that <m>\Phi(gh)(a) = (\Phi(g) \circ \Phi(h))(a)</m> for an arbitrary <m>a \in G</m> as follows:
        <md>
          <mrow>\Phi(gh)(a) \amp = (gh)a \amp  [\text{ definition of }  \Phi(gh)]</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = g(ha) \amp  [\text{ associativity of } G]</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = g(\Phi(h)(a)) \amp  [\text{ definition of }  \Phi(h)]</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\Phi(g) \circ \Phi(h)(a). \amp  [\text{ definition of }  \Phi(g)]</mrow>

        (<em>historical background</em>) Arthur Cayley
            <idx><h>Cayley, Arthur</h></idx>
        was born in England in 1821,
        though he spent much of the first part of his life in Russia,
        where his father was a merchant.
        Cayley was educated at Cambridge,
        where he took the first Smith's Prize in mathematics.
        A lawyer for much of his adult life,
        he wrote several papers in his early twenties before entering the legal profession at the age of 25.
        While practicing law he continued his mathematical research,
        writing more than 300 papers during this period of his life.
        These included some of his best work.
        In 1863 he left law to become a professor at Cambridge.
        Cayley wrote more than 900 papers in fields such as group theory,
        geometry, and linear algebra.
        His legal knowledge was very valuable to Cambridge;
        he participated in the writing of many of the university's statutes.
        Cayley was also one of the people responsible for the admission of women to Cambridge.
