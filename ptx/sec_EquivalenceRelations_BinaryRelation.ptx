    Recall that according to <xref ref="definition_Functions_functionDef">Definition</xref>,
    any function <m>f \colon A \to B</m> can be represented as a set of ordered pairs.
    More precisely,
    each element of<nbsp/><m>f</m> is an ordered pair <m>(a,b)</m>,
    such that <m>a \in A</m> and <m>b \in B</m>.
    Therefore, every element of<nbsp/><m>f</m> is an element of <m>A \times B</m>,
    so <m>f</m><nbsp/>is a subset of <m>A \times B</m>.
    There are however subsets of
    <m>A \times B</m> that are not functions.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="example_EquivalenceRelations_bbal">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>P</m> be the set of all professional basketball players in the NBA<fn>
        National Basketball Association,
        <q>men's professional basketball league in North America <m>\ldots</m> widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.</q>
        (Wikipedia)
        </fn> and let <m>T</m> be the set of NBA teams.
        <m>f_T: P \to T</m> as follows:
        <me>
          f_T(p)=\text{ the team that } p \text{ plays for }
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively,
        <m>f_T</m> can be represented as the set of ordered pairs:
        <me>
          f_T=\{\, (p,t)  \in  P \times T  \mid  p  \text{  is a member of }  t\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand,
        we may be interested not just in players' current teams,
        but in <em>all</em> teams that players have played for.
        This relationship could also be characterized by a set of ordered pairs:
        <me>
          \{\, (p,t)  \in  P \times T  \mid  p  \text{  has at one time or another played for }  t\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is <em>not</em> a function,
        because many NBA players have played on more than one team.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    In light of the previous example,
    it makes mathematical sense to define a relation between sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> to be a set of ordered pairs;
    that is, a relation between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is any subset of <m>A \times B</m>.
    Unlike the case of functions,
    there are no restrictions<ndash/>every subset is a relation.

    So far we've been discussing relations in a non-numerical context,
    but our definitions apply to relations on sets of numbers as well.
    Relations on <m>\mathbb{R}</m>
    (or subsets of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>)
    are discussed in many middle or high school algebra courses.
    Any graph in the <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> plane gives a relation;
    and conversely, any relation involving subsets of
    <m>\mathbb{R}</m> can be represented as a graph in the plane.
    Relations in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> are often taught along with functions:
    for example,
    students are given a graph of some discrete or continuous relation in the
    <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> plane and asked to determine if the given relation is a function.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="example_EquivalenceRelations_r2relation">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the graphs in <xref ref="fig_graphrelations">Figure</xref>,
        where the set <m>A \times B</m> is indicated at the top of each graph.
        Which are relations in <m>A \times B</m>?
        Which are binary relations?
        Which are functions?

      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            All three graphs are relations because all graphs are subsets of <m>A \times B</m>
            (as specified at the top of each graph).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The first and third relations are binary relations,

        <li>
          <p>
            The first is not a function,
            because e.g. both <m>(1,1)</m> and <m>(1,-1)</m> are in the graph.
            The second is a function because it is uniquely defined on all of <m>A</m>
            (in this case <m>A=\mathbb{R}</m>).
            The third is not a function because e.g. there is no pair of the form <m>(-1,y)</m>,
            so the function is not defined on all of <m>A</m>.

        Notice that all of these sets are subsets of <m>A \times B</m>.
        The final example is the set <m>A \times B</m> itself.
        Notice that <m>\emptyset</m> is a valid relation because it's a subset of
        <m>A \times B</m> (a subset with no elements).
        On the other hand, the set <m>\{ \emptyset \}</m> is
        <em>not</em> a relation,
        because it is a set with one element
        (namely <m>\emptyset</m>),
        and this element is not an element of <m>A \times B</m>.
        For similar reasons, <m>\{(1, \emptyset) \}</m> is

    We commonly use symbols such as
    <m>=, \lt  , \subset, \ldots</m> that are used to compare elements of a set.
    You may have called these
    <q>relations</q>
    in your high school algebra class <mdash/> and in fact,
    they can all be considered as binary relations in the sense of <xref ref="definition_EquivalenceRelations_relation">Definition</xref>.
    For example,
    using the symbol <m>\lt</m> we can define the following binary relation on <m>{\mathbb R}</m> :
    <me>
      R_\lt   := \{\, (x,y) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \mid x \lt  y \}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    (here the symbol
    <q><m>:=</m></q>
    means
    <q>defined as</q>).
    Note that <m>R_\lt</m> here is a subset of <m>\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</m>,
    so it is indeed a binary relation according to <xref ref="definition_EquivalenceRelations_relation">Definition</xref>.

    shows that any comparison symbol applied to a set gives rise to a binary relation.
    So rather than writing <m>R_\lt , R_>, R_=</m> and so on,
    we simply use the comparison symbol itself to represent the binary relation.
    Notice that technically, '<m>\lt</m>' defined on
    <m>\mathbb{R}</m> is a different relation from '<m>\lt</m>' defined on <m>\mathbb{N}</m>:
    we will always make it very clear on which set the relation is being defined.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will use the symbol <m>\rel</m>
    (which may be read as
    <q>is related to</q>,
    <q>tilde</q>, or
    <q>twiddle</q>
    )
    to denote a generic comparison symbol.
    If we are working with the set <m>A</m>,
    then the symbol <m>\rel</m> also represents the binary relation <m>A_\rel := \{\, (x,y) \in A \times A \mid x \rel y \}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have shown that comparison symbols give rise to relations:
    the reverse is also true.
    Given a relation <m>R</m> defined on the set <m>A</m>,
    we can define a comparison symbol <m>\rel</m> applied to <m>a,b \in A</m> as follows:
    <m>a \rel b</m> iff <m>(a,b) \in R</m>.
