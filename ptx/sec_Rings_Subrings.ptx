  <title>Subrings</title>
  <p>
    Earlier we mentioned that two important topics studied in Abstract Algebra are groups and rings.
    Just like groups have subgroups,
    rings have <em>subrings</em>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        {subring} A ring that is a subset of another ring is called a <term>subring</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Suppose <m>R</m> is a ring, and <m>S\subset R</m>.
    To prove <m>S</m> is a subring,
    we must show that <m>S</m> satisfies all seven ring properties.
    <m>S</m> will inherit certain properties (associativity,
    commutativity,
    and distributive) from <m>R</m>,
    making lighter work of our proof that <m>S</m> is also a ring.
  </p>
  <p>
    To show that <m>S\subset R</m> is a ring,
    we must show the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Additive Inverse: <m>a\in S\implies-a\in S</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Closure: <m>a,b\in S\implies~a+b\in S</m> and <m>ab\in S</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Zero: <m>0\in S</m>, such that
          <m>0+a=a+0=a</m>, for all <m>a\in S</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One: <m>1\in S</m>, such that
          <m>1\cdot a=a\cdot 1=a</m>, for all <m>a\in S</m>.
          Note that for <m>S</m> to be a subring of <m>R</m>,
          the multiplicative identities must be the <em>same</em>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>S</m> is a subring of <m>R</m>
    <em>except</em> that <m>1\notin S</m>,
    then <m>S</m> is a <em>subring</em>
    of <m>R</m> <em>without unity</em>.
        <idx><h>Subring</h><h>Without unity</h></idx>
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples of subrings:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is a subring in <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>{\mathbb R}</m> is a subring of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>R</m> is a ring, then <m>R</m> is a subring of <m>R[x]</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's look at a subring proof together:
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given two rings <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m> which share the same + and <m>\cdot</m> operations,
        show that <m>R_1 \cap R_2</m> is a subring of both <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let's begin by showing that <m>R_1 \cap R_2\subset R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m>.
        By definition of <m>\cap, ~a\in R_1\cap R_2\implies a\in R_1</m> and <m>a\in R_2</m>.
        So <m>R_1 \cap R_2\subset R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we will show the additive inverse property.
        Let <m>a</m> be an arbitrary element in <m>R_1 \cap R_2</m>.
        Then <m>a\in R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m>,
        by the definition of <m>\cap</m>.
        Remember that <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m> are rings with the same + operation,
        so <m>-a\in R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m>.
        This means that <m>-a\in R_1 \cap R_2</m> and the additive inverse property holds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our next task is to show that
        <m>R_1 \cap R_2</m> contains the zero element.
        Since <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m> are rings with the same + operation,
        then <m>0\in R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m>.
        By definition of <m>\cap, ~0\in R_1 \cap R_2</m>,
        and the zero property holds.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following exercise,
        you will complete the proof that
        <m>R_1\cap R_2</m> is a subring by showing that it has a multiplicative identity.
      </p>
      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Given rings <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m>,
            with the same <m>\cdot</m> operation, Show that <m>1\in R_1 \cap R_2</m>.
            You can model your proof after the zero property proof.

    In <xref ref="sec_Rings_DefinitionsAndExamples">Section</xref>,
    we learned that <m>{\mathbb C}</m>,
    the set of all complex numbers, forms a ring.
    Consider the following subset of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>:
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove or disprove:
        <m>\{1,-1,i,-i\}</m> forms a subring of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>{\mathbb Z}+{\mathbb Z}i</m> denote the set of complex numbers with real and imaginary parts that are both integers.
        Prove or disprove <m>{\mathbb Z}+{\mathbb Z}i</m> is a subring of <m>{\mathbb C}</m>.

    The set <m>n{\mathbb Z}</m> represents the set of all integers,
    <m>n\cdot k\in{\mathbb Z}</m>,
    such that <m>n</m> is some integer and <m>k\in{\mathbb Z}</m>.
    For example,
    <m>2{\mathbb Z}</m> represents the set of all even integers.
    It should be clear that <m>n{\mathbb Z}\subset{\mathbb Z}</m>,
    for all <m>n\in{\mathbb N}</m>,
    but is it a subring as well?

    If <m>R</m> is a finite ring,
    the addition and multiplication Cayley tables for <m>S</m> can be obtained from the corresponding tables of <m>R</m>.
    We can cross out the rows and columns with heading elements in <m>R</m> that are
    <em>not</em> also in <m>S</m>.
    Let's look at an example.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>\{0,2,4\}</m> is a subring of <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> without unity.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The Cayley tables for modular addition and modular multiplication of <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> are:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <image width="65%" source="images/origTables.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Now, we are wanting only <m>\{0,2,4\}</m> of <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m>.
        We will keep those values and cross out all rows and columns that are not <m>\{0,2,4\}</m>.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <image width="65%" source="images/crossOutTables.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        This results in the following:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <image width="43%" source="images/newCayleyTables.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Since all the rows and columns have all the elements
        <m>\{0,2,4\}</m> in the modular addition and modular multiplication tables,
        then all four subring properties are satisfied and
        <m>\{0,2,4\}</m> is a subring of <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m>
      </p>
    </proof>
  </example>
  <p>
    We can generalize this idea with the following exercise.
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>R={\mathbb Z}_{mn}</m> and <m>S=\{0,m,2m,...(n-1)m\}</m>,
        then <m>S</m> is a subring of <m>R</m> without unity.
        (<m>{\mathbb Z}_6={\mathbb Z}_{mn}</m>,
        where <m>m=2</m> and <m>n=3</m>.)
      </p>
    </statement>
