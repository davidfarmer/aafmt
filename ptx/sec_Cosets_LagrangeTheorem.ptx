    <title>Lagrange's theorem</title>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the chapter,
      we compared cosets to layers of an onion.
      Indeed, as we saw in the last section,
      this is a good analogy because the cosets of a subgroup partition the group.
      However, an even better analogy is to slices of a loaf of sandwich bread<ndash/>because as we'll see in this section,
      every coset of a particular subgroup within a given group has exactly the same size.
    </p>
    <p>
      What may we conclude from this?
      Let's push our analogy with sandwich bread a little farther.
      Suppose the bread has raisins in it,
      and each slice has exactly the same number of raisins.
      Then the number of raisins in the loaf must be equal to the sum of all raisins in all the slices, that is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>|</m>raisins in loaf<m>|</m> = <m>|</m>raisins in each slice<m>| \cdot |</m>slices<m>|</m>,
    </p>
    <p>
      where as usual the <m>| \cdots |</m> notation signifies
      <q>size</q>
      or
      <q>number of</q>. Applying this same reasoning to groups and their subgroups leads to a very general result called
      <em>Lagrange's theorem</em>.
      This far-reaching theorem will enable us to prove some surprising properties of subgroups,
      their elements, and even some results in number theory.
      So let's get started.

    <remark xml:id="left_is_right">
      <p>
        In the following discussion,
        for specificity's sake we will use left coset notation.
        However, just lke we saw in the last section
        (<xref ref="right_is_left">Remark</xref>),
        everything we say about left cosets is also true for right cosets.
        Indeed, to prove the cases for the right cosets,
        you simply need to take the left coset proofs given below and switch around each coset expression and group operation.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      As mentioned above,
      to prove Lagrange's theorem we first need to prove that every left coset of a subgroup has the exactly the same size:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Cosets_cosets_theorem_4">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> with <m>g \in G</m> and define a map
          <m>\phi:H \rightarrow gH</m> by <m>\phi(h) = gh</m>.
          The map <m>\phi</m> is a bijection;
          hence, the number of elements in <m>H</m> is the same as the number of elements in <m>gH</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We first show that the map <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one.
        Suppose that <m>\phi(h_1) = \phi(h_2)</m> for elements <m>h_1, h_2 \in H</m>.
        We must show that <m>h_1 = h_2</m>,
        but <m>\phi(h_1) = gh_1</m> and <m>\phi(h_2) = gh_2</m>.
        So <m>gh_1 = gh_2</m>, and by left cancellation <m>h_1= h_2</m>.
        To show that <m>\phi</m> is onto is easy.
        By definition every element of <m>gH</m> is of the form <m>gh</m> for some <m>h \in H</m> and <m>\phi(h) = gh</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Given this proposition Lagrange's theorem falls right out:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Cosets_LagrangeTheorem">
      <statement>
        <p>
          (<term>Lagrange's theorem</term>) Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
          Then <m>|G|/|H| = [G : H]</m> is the number of distinct left cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>.
          In particular,
          the number of elements in <m>H</m> must divide the number of elements in <m>G</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The group <m>G</m> is partitioned into <m>[G : H]</m> distinct left cosets.
        Each left coset has <m>|H|</m> elements;
        therefore, <m>|G| = [G : H] |H|</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Consider for a moment what we've just proven.
      The number of elements in a subgroup <em>must</em>
      divide evenly into the number of elements in the group;
      you can't have just any number of elements in a subgroup.
      This is a very powerful tool to give insight into the structure of groups.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a group with <m>|G|=25</m>.
          Then since <m>2</m> doesn't divide 25 evenly, Lagrange's theorem implies that <m>G</m> can't possibly have a subgroup with 2 elements.

        (<em>historical background</em>) Joseph-Louis Lagrange
            <idx><h>Lagrange, Joseph-Louis</h></idx>
        (1736<ndash/>1813), born in Turin, Italy,
        was of French and Italian descent.
        His talent for mathematics became apparent at an early age.
        Leonhard Euler
            <idx><h>Euler, Leonhard</h></idx>
        recognized Lagrange's abilities when Lagrange, who was only 19,
        communicated to Euler some work that he had done in the calculus of variations.
        That year he was also named a professor at the Royal Artillery School in Turin.
        At the age of 23 he joined the Berlin Academy.
        Frederick the Great had written to Lagrange proclaiming that the
        <q>greatest king in Europe</q>
        should have the
        <q>greatest mathematician in Europe</q>
        at his court.
        For 20 years Lagrange held the position vacated by his mentor, Euler.
        His works include contributions to number theory,
        group theory, physics and mechanics,
        the calculus of variations,
        the theory of equations, and differential equations.
        Along with Laplace and Lavoisier, Lagrange was one of the people responsible for designing the metric system.
        During his life Lagrange profoundly influenced the development of mathematics,
        leaving much to the next generation of mathematicians in the form of examples and new problems to be solved.

    <title>Orders of elements, Euler's theorem, Fermat's little theorem, and prime order</title>
    <p>
      Now let's really put Lagrange's theorem to work.
      Note that Lagrange's theorem is an extremely general result<ndash/>it applies to <em>any</em>
      subgroup of <em>any</em> finite group.
      So let's consider one particular type of subgroup,
      namely cyclic subgroups of the form
      <m>\langle g \rangle</m> where <m>g</m> is an element of a given group <m>G</m>. (See <xref ref="proposition_Groups_OrbitIsSubgroup">Proposition</xref>
      in <xref ref="subsec_Groups_GroupProperties_CyclicSubgroups">Section</xref>
      for the definition of <m>\langle g \rangle</m> and the proof that it is indeed a group).
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Cosets_cosets_theorem_6">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>G</m> is a finite group and <m>g \in G</m>.
          Then the order of <m>g</m> must divide the number of elements in <m>G</m>.
        </p>

    <proof>
      <p>
        The order of a group element <m>g</m>,
        which is denoted as <m>|g|</m>,
        is defined in <xref ref="definition_Groups_DefOrder">Definition</xref>
        in <xref ref="subsec_Groups_GroupProperties_CyclicSubgroups">Section</xref>.
        We indicated in <xref ref="exercise_Groups_OrderEltCyclic">Exercise</xref>
        in that same section that <m>|g|</m> is equal to <m>|\langle g \rangle|</m>,
        which is the order of the cylic subgroup generated by <m>g</m>.
        It follows immediately from Lagrange's theorem that <m>|g|</m> must divide <m>|G|</m>.

      To show the power of this result,
      we'll apply it to the group of units <m>U(n)</m> which was introduced in <xref ref="subsec_Groups_Examples_GroupOfUnits">Section</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before we do this, let's do some exploration.
      Recall that the elements of <m>U(n)</m> are the positive integers that are less than <m>n</m> and relatively prime to <m>n</m> (we showed in <xref ref="exercise_Groups_U_n__abgroup">Exercise</xref>
      of <xref ref="subsec_Groups_Examples_GroupOfUnits">Section</xref>
      that these elements actually form a group.

          Alternatively,
          we can say that <m>\phi(n)</m> is the number of natural numbers <m>m</m> where <m>m \lt n</m> and <m>\gcd(m,n) = 1</m>.
          In order to make <m>\phi</m> a function on the natural numbers,

      If we now apply Lagrange's theorem to <m>U(n)</m>,
      we obtain an important result in number theory which was first proved by Leonhard Euler in 1763.

          Then <m>a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        First, let <m>r</m> be the remainder when <m>a</m> is divided by <m>n</m>.
        We may consider <m>r</m> as an element of <m>U(n)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As noted above, the order of <m>U(n)</m> is <m>\phi(n)</m>.
        Lagrange's theorem then tells us that <m>|r|</m> divides <m>\phi(n)</m>,
        so we can write:
        <m>\phi(n) = k|r|</m>, where <m>k \in {\mathbb N}</m>.
        Consequently, considering <m>r</m> as an element of <m>U(n)</m>,
        we have <m>r^{\phi(n)} = r^{k|r|} = (r^{|r|})^k = (1)^k=1</m>
        (take note that the multiplication that is being used here is
        <em>modular</em> multiplication,
        not regular multiplication).

      We can also apply <xref ref="proposition_Cosets_cosets_theorem_6">Proposition</xref> to groups of prime order,
      as in the following exercise.
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise_Cosets_primeGroups">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a group such that <m>|G| = p</m>,
          where <m>p</m> is a prime number.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <p>
                Let <m>a</m> be an element of <m>G \setminus \{e\}</m>.
                What does <xref ref="proposition_Cosets_cosets_theorem_6">Proposition</xref>
                tell us about <m>|a|</m>? (Recall that <sq><m>\setminus</m></sq> is the set difference operation,
                defined in <xref ref="definition_Sets_setDifference">Definition</xref>). (*Hint*)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Prove that <m>G</m> is cyclic.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Describe the set of generators of <m>G</m> (recall that <m>g \in G</m> is a generator of <m>G</m> if <m>\langle g \rangle = G</m>.)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      The results of the preceding exercise can be summarized as follows:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Cosets_cosets_theorem_7">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>|G| = p</m> with <m>p</m> a prime number.
          Then <m>G</m> is cyclic and any <m>g \in G</m> such that <m>g \neq e</m> is a generator.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Later we will use this proposition to show that all groups of prime order <m>p</m> are the
      <q>same</q>
      in some sense
      (see <xref ref="subsec_Isomorphism_Classification_CylicGroup">Section</xref>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we can use Lagrange's theorem to show that groups of prime order have a very simple structure:
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise_Cosets_prime_simple">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a group of prime order.
          Use <xref ref="proposition_Cosets_cosets_theorem_7">Proposition</xref>
          to show that the only proper subgroup of <m>G</m> is the trivial subgroup <m>\{e\}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      <xref ref="exercise_Cosets_prime_simple">Exercise</xref>
      shows that groups of prime order
      (such as <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m>)
      are
      <q>simple</q>
      in the sense that they don't contain any nontrivial subgroups.
      In <xref ref="subsec_Cosets_FactoringSimpleGroups_Concept">Section</xref> we will talk more about
      <q>simple</q>
      groups.
