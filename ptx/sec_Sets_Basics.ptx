      You've probably seen sets,
      set relations, and set operations in previous classes.
      In fact, in the previous two chapters of this book you've already been working with sets.
      So we'll review them quickly before moving on to further properties and proofs concerning sets and their accessories.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chapter is an adapted and expanded version of a chapter by D. and J. Morris.

    <title>Definition and examples</title>
    <p>
      First of all, let's give a precise mathematical definition for
      <q>set</q>:
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="sets_membership">
      <statement>
        <p>
          {defSet} A <term>set</term>
              <idx><h>Set</h><h>definition of</h></idx>
          is a well-defined collection of objects:
          that is, it is defined in such a manner that we can determine for any given object <m>x</m> whether or not <m>x</m> belongs to the set.
          The objects that belong to a set are called its <term>elements</term>
              <idx><h>Element</h><h>of a set</h></idx>
              <idx><h>Set</h><h>elements</h></idx>
          or <term>members</term>.
          We will denote sets by capital letters,
          such as <m>A</m> or <m>X</m>;
          if <m>a</m> is an element of the set <m>A</m>, we write <m>a \in A</m> .
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Two common ways of specifying sets are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            by listing all of its elements inside a pair of braces; or
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            by stating the property that determines whether or not an object <m>x</m> belongs to the set.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      we could define a particular set <m>E</m> by listing its elements:
      <me>
        E = \{2, 4, 6, \ldots \}
      </me>,
      or by specifying properties which characterize its elements:
      <me>
        E = \{ x :  x > 0  \textrm{ and }  x \textrm{ is divisible by 2} \}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (here the
      <q>:</q>
      signifies
      <q>such that</q>).
      We can also describe <m>E</m> in a less mathy way by simply calling it
      <q>the set of positive even numbers</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We write <m>2 \in E</m> when we want to say that 2 is in the set <m>E</m>,
      and <m>-3 \notin E</m> to say that <m>-3</m> is not in the set <m>E</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sets don't have to involve numbers.
      For example, we could define a certain set <m>X</m> by listing:
      <me>
        X = \{\textrm{Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday}  \}
      </me>,
      or by property:
      <me>
        X = \{ x :x \text{ is the name of a weekday (in English) } \}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this book,
      it would be good enough to say,
      <q><m>X</m> is the set of weekday names (in English)</q>
      (we're not so snobby about set brackets).
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise_Sets_set1">
      <statement>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <p>
              What elements are in the following set:
              <me>
                S = \{x : x  \textrm{ is the name of a U.S. state and }  x  \textrm{ begins with `W'}  \}
              </me>
              Write the set as a list of objects.
            </p>

              Rewrite the following as a list =<m>\{x : x \textrm{ is a type of regular polygon with less than 6 sides} \}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Rewrite the following set of dates by using a property:
              <me>
                T = \{ \textrm{Jan. 4th  2011, Jan. 11th  2011, Jan. 18  2011, Jan. 25  2011} , \ldots, \textrm{Dec. 27 2011}  \}
              </me>
              (Note: January 1 2011 was on a Saturday).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Write the set of odd integers <m>O</m>: (i) as a list,
              and (ii) by using a property.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      It is possible for the elements of a set to be sets in their own right.
      For instance, we could define
      <me>
        T = \{ x : x \mathrm{~is~a~National~League~baseball~team} \}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more mathematical
      (but less interesting)
      example would be
      <me>
        S = \{ x : x \mathrm{~is~a~set~of~integers} \}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then elements of <m>S</m> would include the sets <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m>,
      <m>\{\textrm{the set of odd integers} \}</m>,
      <m>\{ 0 \}</m>, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can even go farther, and define sets of sets of sets.
      For instance,
      the set <m>L</m> of major baseball leagues in the U.S. has two elements:
      <me>
        L = \{ \text{ American League, National League }  \}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the American League <m>A</m> consists of a set of teams:
      <me>
        A = \{ \text{ Yankees, Red Sox, }  \ldots \}
      </me>,
      whle the National League <m>N</m> also consists of a set of teams:
      <me>
        N = \{ \text{ Cubs, Phillies, }  \ldots \}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these teams consists of a set of players:
      so altogether the set <m>L</m> is a set of sets of sets!
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise_Sets_SetSet">
      <statement>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <p>
              Describe the <m>21^{st}</m> century as a set of sets of sets of sets of sets of sets of sets. (*Hint*)

      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      This notion of
      <q>sets of sets</q>
      can bring us into dangerous territory.
      For example, consider the set
      <me>
        S = \{ x : x \mathrm{~is~a~set~which~is~not~an~element~of~itself} \}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may then pose the question:
      is <m>S</m> an element of itself?<fn>
      This question is called <term>Russell's paradox</term>,
      and plays an important role in the history of set theory.
      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us consider the possibilities:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose first that <m>S</m> is an element of itself.
            Then <m>S</m> must satisfy the defining property of elements of  <m>S</m> <mdash/> that is,
            <m>S</m> must be an example of a set <m>x</m> for which
            <q><m>x</m> is  not an element of itself.</q>
            It follows that <m>S</m> is not an element of itself.
            This contradicts our supposition <mdash/> so apparently our supposition is wrong,
            and <m>S</m> must not be an element of itself.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            On the other hand, suppose that <m>S</m> is not an element of itself.
            Then <m>S</m> satisfies the defining property of elements of  <m>S</m> <mdash/> that is,
            <m>S</m> is an example of a set <m>x</m> for which
            <q><m>x</m> is  not an element of itself.</q>
            It follows that <m>S</m> is an element of <m>S</m>.
            Once again this contradicts our supposition <mdash/> so apparently <m>S</m> must be an element of itself!
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we get out of this mess?
      No matter what we assume, we end up with a contradiction!
      The problem, as is often the case,
      lies in <em>hidden assumptions</em> that we have made.
      Our definition of <m>S</m> makes reference to the unknown <m>x</m>,
      where <m>x</m> is an
      <q>arbitrary</q>
      set.
      Herein lies the rub: the notion of
      <q>arbitrary</q>
      set is <em>not well-defined</em>.
      Put another way: the set of
      <q>all possible sets</q>
      is NOT a set!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following discussion we will avoid this problem by always starting out with a well-defined set that contains all the sets and elements of interest in a particular example or problem.
      Such an all-encompassing set is referred to as a
      <term>universal set</term>.
          <idx><h>Universal set</h></idx>
      Note each particular problem will have its own universal set.
      For instance,
      if we are talking about public opinion polls in the United States,
      an appropriate universal set might be the set of American citizens.
      If we're talking about sets of prime and composite numbers,
      our universal set could be either the set of integers,
      or the set of natural numbers.
      If we are talking about roots of algebraic equations,
      depending on our particular interest we might choose the universal set to be the set of real numbers,
      or the set of complex numbers.
      When we talk about sets in a general way,
      we often denote sets by captial letters
      <m>A, B, C,..</m>., and it's assumed that all these sets are subsets of some universal set <m>U</m>.

  <subsection xml:id="subset_Sets_ImportantSets">
    <title>Important sets of numbers</title>
    <p>
      We will refer often to the following sets of numbers.
      Although we are presuming that these sets are
      <q>given</q>, the reader should be aware that it's not at all easy to formally define them in a mathematically precise way.
      (Although we won't give any definitions here,
      you may encounter them in other mathematics courses,
      such as logic or analysis.)

            <em><em>not</em></em> include <m>0</m>.
            Some books include <m>0</m> as a natural number.)

          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      You may recall that in <xref ref="ComplexNumbers">Chapter</xref>,
      we defined the set of complex numbers <m>{\mathbb C}</m> as
      <me>
        {\mathbb C} := \{ x + iy, \text{ such that }  x,y \in {\mathbb R} \}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is just one example of a favorite gambit of mathematicians,
      namely creating new sets from existing sets in various imaginative ways.
      You'll be seeing many more examples of this as we go along.

    <p>
      According to <xref ref="definition_Sets_subset">Definition</xref>,
      every set is a subset of itself.
      That is, for any set <m>A</m>,
      <m>A \subset A</m>, since every element in <m>A</m> is
      (of course)
      in <m>A</m>.
      Sometimes though we may want to take about subsets of <m>A</m> that really are strictly contained in <m>A</m>,
      without being all of <m>A</m>.
      Such subsets are called <em>proper subsets</em>.
          <idx><h>Subset</h><h>proper</h></idx>
      Formally, a set <m>B</m> is a <term>proper subset</term>
      of a set <m>A</m> if <m>B \subset A</m> and <m>B \neq A</m>.
      For instance, if John and Jane Doe had only sons,
      then <m>\{\textrm{sons of John and Jane Doe} \}</m> is not a proper subset of \{ children of John and Jane Doe\}.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In this book, we use <sq><m>\subset</m></sq> for subset,
        and we have no special symbol to distinguish
        <q>proper subset</q>
        from
        <q>subset</q>. Some authors use <sq><m>\subseteq</m></sq> to denote subset,
        and <sq><m>\subset</m></sq> to denote proper subset.
        This has the advantage that then <sq><m>\subseteq</m></sq> and <sq><m>\supseteq</m></sq> are similar to <sq><m>\le</m></sq> and <sq><m>\ge</m></sq>,
        while <sq><m>\subset</m></sq> and <sq><m>\supset</m></sq> are like <sq><m>\lt</m></sq> and <sq><m>></m></sq>.
        But we rarely have to distinguish the case of proper subsets,
        so it's not worth defining a special symbol for them.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      If <m>A</m> is not a subset of <m>B</m>,
      we write <m>A \not \subset B</m>;
      for example,
      <m>\{4, 7, 9\} \not \subset \{2, 4, 5, 8, 9 \}</m>.
      Two sets are <term>equal</term>, written <m>A = B</m>,
      if we can show that <m>A \subset B</m> and <m>B \subset A</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is convenient to have a set with no elements in it.
      This set is called the <term>empty set</term>
          <idx><h>Empty set</h></idx>
          <idx><h>Set</h><h>empty set</h></idx>
      and is denoted by <m>\emptyset</m> . For instance,

      In a similar way, we can construct new sets out of old sets using
      <em>set operations</em>.
          <idx><h>Set operations</h></idx>
      The mathematical definitions of the basic set operations are as follows:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {union} The <term>union</term>
          <m>A \cup B</m> of two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is defined as<idx><h>Set operations</h><h>union</h></idx>
              <idx><h>Union</h></idx>
          <men xml:id="union">
            A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \text{ or }  x \in B \};
          </men>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {intersection} the <term>intersection</term>
          of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is defined by <idx><h>Set operations</h><h>intersection</h></idx>
              <idx><h>Intersection</h></idx>
          <men xml:id="intersection">
            A \cap B = \{x :  x \in A \text{ and }  x \in B \}
          </men>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      For example:
      if <m>A = \{1, 3, 5\}</m> and <m>B = \{ 1, 2, 3, 9 \}</m>, then
      <me>
        A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 5, 9 \} \text{ and } A \cap B = \{ 1, 3 \}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also consider the union and the intersection of more than two sets.
      For instance, the union of three sets <m>A_1, A_2</m>,
      and <m>A_3</m> can be written
      <m>A_{1} \cup A_2 \cup A_3</m> or <m>\bigcup_{i = 1}^{3} A_{i}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, the intersection of the same three sets can be written as
      <m>A_{1} \cap A_2 \cap A_3</m> or <m>\bigcap_{i = 1}^{3} A_i</m>.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        There's actually a technical difficulty with our notations for
        <m>A_{1} \cup A_2 \cup A_3</m> and <m>A_{1} \cap A_2 \cap A_3</m>.
        The problem is that the notation is ambiguous:
        does <m>A_{1} \cup A_2 \cup A_3</m> mean
        <m>(A_{1} \cup A_2) \cup A_3</m> or <m>A_{1} \cup (A_2 \cup A_3)</m>?
        As it turns out, it doesn't make any difference
        (we'll show this in the next section).
        Since it doesn't matter which order we do the <m>\cup</m>,
        we just leave off the parentheses
        (and the same for <m>\cap</m>).
        This is really nothing new:
        you're used to writing <m>3 + 4 + 7 + 9</m> instead of <m>((3+4)+7)+9</m>,
        because it doesn't matter what order you add the numbers.
