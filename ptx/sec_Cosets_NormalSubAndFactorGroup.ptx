  <title>Normal subgroups and factor groups</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We saw in <xref ref="sec_Cosets_Definition">Section</xref>
      that if <m>H</m> is a subgroup of a group <m>G</m>,
      then right cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m> are not always the same as left cosets.
      The <em>number</em> of right cosets and left cosets are always equal,
      and the number of elements in the left and right cosets match;
      but the right and left cosets <em>themselves</em> may not equal each other
      (it is not always the case that <m>gH = Hg</m> for all <m>g \in G</m>).
      But as we saw sometimes they do equal each other.
      The subgroups for which this property holds play a critical role in group theory:
      they allow for the construction of a new class of groups,
      called <em>quotient groups</em>
      (or <em>factor groups</em>.

    <title>Normal subgroups</title>
    <p>
      First, let's give a name to these nice subgroups:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {normal_sub} A subgroup <m>H</m> of a group <m>G</m> is <term>normal</term>

              <idx><h>Normal subgroup</h></idx>
          in G if <m>gH = Hg</m> for all <m>g \in G</m>.
          That is, a normal subgroup of a group <m>G</m> is one in which the right and left cosets for every group element are precisely the same.

      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example xml:id="example_Cosets_normal_S3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Think back to <xref ref="example_Cosets_S3_Cosets">Example</xref> earlier in the chapter.
          <m>H</m> was the subgroup of <m>S_3</m> consisting of elements <m>(1)</m> and <m>(12)</m>.
          Since
          <me>
            (123) H = \{ (123), (13) \}  \text{ and }  H (123) = \{ (123), (23) \}

        <p>
          <m>H</m> cannot be a normal subgroup of <m>S_3</m>.
          However, the subgroup <m>N</m>,
          consisting of the permutations <m>(1)</m>, <m>(123)</m>,
          and <m>(132)</m>, is normal since the cosets of <m>N</m> are

            \begin{array}{c} N  =   \{ (1), (123), (132) \} \\ (12) N =  N (12)  =  \{ (12), (13), (23) \}. \end{array}

      The following proposition can be useful when trying to prove that a certain subgroup is normal.
      It gives several different characterizations of normal subgroups.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Cosets_normal_normalequivalents">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>N</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
          Then the following statements are equivalent.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The subgroup <m>N</m> is normal in <m>G</m>.

      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        (1) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (2).
        Since <m>N</m> is normal in <m>G</m>,
        <m>gN = Ng</m> for all <m>g \in G</m>.
        Hence, for a given <m>g \in G</m> and <m>n \in N</m>,
        there exists an <m>n'</m> in <m>N</m> such that <m>g n = n' g</m>.
        Therefore, <m>gng^{-1} = n' \in N</m> or <m>gNg^{-1} \subset N</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (3).
        Let <m>g \in G</m>.
        Since <m>gNg^{-1} \subset N</m>,
        we need only show <m>N \subset gNg^{-1}</m>.
        For <m>n \in N</m>, <m>g^{-1}ng=g^{-1}n(g^{-1})^{-1} \in N</m>.
        Hence, <m>g^{-1}ng = n'</m> for some <m>n' \in N</m>.
        Therefore, <m>n = g n' g^{-1}</m> is in <m>g N g^{-1}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) <m>\Rightarrow</m> (1).
        Suppose that <m>gNg^{-1} = N</m> for all <m>g \in G</m>.
        Then for any <m>n \in N</m> there exists an
        <m>n' \in N</m> such that <m>gng^{-1} = n'</m>.
        Consequently, <m>gn = n' g</m> or <m>gN \subset Ng</m>.
        Similarly, <m>Ng \subset gN</m>.

      So what's the hubbub about these normal subgroups?
      We've been promising a grand revelation.
      It turns out that the cosets of normal subgroups have some very special properties.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Cosets_factor_Z3">
      <p>
        Consider the normal subgroup <m>3 {\mathbb Z}</m> of
        <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> that we started exploring at the beginning of the chapter.
        The cosets of <m>3 {\mathbb Z}</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> were
        <md>
          <mrow>0 + 3 {\mathbb Z} \amp  = \{ \ldots, -3, 0, 3, 6, \ldots \}</mrow>
          <mrow>1 + 3 {\mathbb Z} \amp  = \{ \ldots, -2, 1, 4, 7, \ldots \}</mrow>
          <mrow>2 + 3 {\mathbb Z} \amp  = \{ \ldots, -1, 2, 5, 8, \ldots \}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now just for curiosity's sake,
        let's say we took <em>every</em>
        element in <m>0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}</m> and added them to <em>every</em>
        element in <m>1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}</m>.
        What would be the resulting set?
        Try some examples:
        take an arbitrary element of <m>0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}</m>,
        and add to it an arbitrary element of <m>1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}</m>.
        You will find that the result is always in <m>1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}</m>.
        Let's give a proof of this.
        First let's give some notation:
      </p>
      <definition>
        <statement>
          <p>
            {setplus}(<term>Set addition</term>) Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two sets of real numbers.
            Then the <term>sum</term>
                <idx><h>Sum</h><h>of sets</h></idx>
            <m>A + B</m> is defined as the set:
            <me>
              A + B := \{a + b, \mathrm{~where~} a \in A \text{ and }  b \in B\}
            </me>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      <p>
        Notice that we are giving a <em>new</em>
        meaning to the symbol <sq>+</sq>,
        because we are applying it to <em>sets</em>
        rather than <em>numbers</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of this new notation,
        what we're trying to prove is:
        <me>
          (0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) + (1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) = 1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we've done many times before,
        we may prove that these two sets are equal by showing that all elements of the left-hand set are contained in the right-hand set,
        and vice versa.
        So let's take an arbitrary element of <m>(0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) + (1 + 3 {\mathbb Z})</m>.
        We may write this element as
        <m>(0 + 3m) + (1 + 3n)</m>, where <m>m,n \in \ZZ</m>.
        Basic algebra gives us:
        <me>
          (0 + 3m) + (1 + 3 n) = 1 + 3(m+ n)
        </me>,
        which is in <m>1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}</m>.
        This shows that:
        <me>
          (0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) + (1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) \subset 1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand,
        we may write an arbitrary element of <m>1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}</m> as <m>1 + 3k</m>,
        which is equal to <m>0 + (1 + 3k)</m>.
        Since <m>0 \in 0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}</m>, we have
        <me>
          (0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) + (1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}) \supset 1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}
        </me>,
        and the proof is complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's step back and see what we've done.
        We've taken one coset of <m>3 {\mathbb Z}</m> (i.e.
        <m>0 + 3\ZZ</m>), and
        <q>added</q>
        a second coset (i.e.
        <m>1 + 3\ZZ</m>) to it, to get a third coset of <m>3 {\mathbb Z}</m>.
        This sounds like closure.
        So let's check that we have it.
        Doing the same thing with all pairs of cosets, we obtain the following
        <q>addition</q>
        table:

      <p>
        So indeed we have closure.
        It's beginning to look like we have a group here.
        Actually, we can see an identity (
        <m>0 + 3 {\mathbb Z}</m>) and an inverse for every coset
        (for example <m>[1 + 3 {\mathbb Z}]^{-1}=2 + 3 {\mathbb Z}</m>).
        It turns that the associative property also holds:
        this follows from the associativity of ordinary addition.
        So we got it:
        the cosets of <m>3 {\mathbb Z}</m> <em>themselves</em>
        form a group! (Note the Cayley table for this group looks suspiciously the same as the Cayley table for <m>{\mathbb Z}_3</m>;
        we'll pick up on this in <xref ref="Isomorphism">Chapter</xref>.)
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      So <em>this</em> is the grand revelation about normal subgroups:
      <em>the cosets of a normal subgroup form a group</em>.
      But we shouldn't jump the gun:
      we've only shown it's true for a special case.
      Now we have to get down to the hard work of proving it in general.
      First we have to generalize <xref ref="definition_Cosets_setplus">Definition</xref> to other group operations.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {setcomp}(<term>Set composition</term>) Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two subsets of a group <m>G</m>.
          Then the <term>composition</term><idx><h>Composition</h><h>of sets</h></idx> <m>A \circ B</m>
          (or <m>AB</m>)
          is defined as the set:
          <me>
            A \circ B := \{a b, \mathrm{~where~} a \in A \text{ and }  b \in B\}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The reason that normal subgroups are special is that set composition defines an operation on cosets:

          If <m>a,b \in G</m> , then <m>aN \circ bN = abN</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The proof parallels the argument in <xref ref="example_Cosets_factor_Z3">Example</xref>.
        Let <m>x \in aN</m> and <m>y \in bN</m>.
        Using <xref ref="exercise_Cosets_normal_mult">Exercise</xref> part (c),
        we may conclude that <m>xy \in abN</m>.
        This shows that <m>aN \circ bN \subset abN</m>.
        On the other hand, let <m>z \in abN</m>.
        Then <m>z = ae \circ b n</m> for some <m>n\in N</m>,
        which implies that <m>z \in aN \circ bN</m>.
        This shows that <m>aN \circ bN \supset abN</m>,
        and the proof is finished.

          Let <m>N</m> be a normal subgroup of a group <m>G</m>.
          The cosets of <m>N</m> in <m>G</m> form a group under the operation of set composition.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We have shown that the set composition operation is well-defined and closed on the set of cosets of <m>N</m>,
        provided that <m>N</m> is normal.
        Associativity follows by the associativity of the group operation defined on <m>G</m>.
        Using <xref ref="proposition_Cosets_norm_comp">Proposition</xref>
        we have that <m>eN \circ aN = aN \circ eN = aN</m>,
        so <m>eN = N</m> is an identity.
        <xref ref="proposition_Cosets_norm_comp">Proposition</xref>
        also gives us that <m>g^{-1}N \circ gN = gN \circ g^{-1}N = eN</m>,
        so the inverse of <m>gN</m> is <m>g^{-1} N</m>.

      the number of cosets of <m>N</m> in <m>G</m>.

    <remark>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="example_Cosets_factor_Z3">Example</xref> above,
        the quotient group would have been labeled <m>{\mathbb Z}/ 3 {\mathbb Z}</m>.
        In general, the subgroup <m>n {\mathbb Z}</m> of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is normal.
        The cosets of the quotient group <m>{\mathbb Z } / n {\mathbb Z}</m> then are
        <me>
          n {\mathbb Z}; 1 + n {\mathbb Z};  2 + n {\mathbb Z};  \cdots (n-1) + n {\mathbb Z}
        </me>.
        and the sum of the cosets <m>k + {\mathbb Z}</m> and
        <m>l + {\mathbb Z}</m> is <m>k+l + {\mathbb Z}</m>.
        Notice that we have written our cosets additively,
        because the group operation is integer addition.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      It is very important to remember that the elements in a quotient group are not the elements of the original group,
      but <em>sets of elements</em> in the original group.
      As well then,
      the operation for the quotient group is not the original operation of the group
      (which was used to compose elements),
      but a convenient derivative of it that we use to compose sets together.
      Both of these facts take a second to get use to, so let's practice:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Cosets_factor_S3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the normal subgroup of
          <m>S_3, H = \{ (1), (123), (132) \}</m> which we started exploring in <xref ref="example_Cosets_S3_Cosets">Example</xref>.
          The cosets of <m>H</m> in <m>S_3</m> were <m>H</m> and <m>(12) N</m>.
          Using the group operation from <xref ref="definition_Cosets_factor_group">Defintion</xref>
          to compose these cosets together,
          the quotient group <m>S_3 / N</m> then has the following Cayley table.
        </p>
        <tabular>
          <row>
            <cell></cell>
            <cell><m>N</m></cell>

        </tabular>
        <p>
          Notice that <m>S_3 / N</m> is a smaller group than <m>S_3</m>
          (<m>2</m> elements compared to <m>6</m> eleemnts).
          So the quotient group then displays a pared down amount of information about <m>S_3</m>.
          Actually, <m>N = A_3</m>, the group of even permutations,
          and <m>(12) N = \{ (12), (13), (23) \}</m> is the set of odd permutations.
          The information captured in <m>G/N</m> is parity;
          that is, multiplying two even or two odd permutations results in an even permutation,
          whereas multiplying an odd permutation by an even permutation yields an odd permutation.
          This information, as well as the Cayley table above,
          might suggest to you that the quotient group is equivalent to another group we know.
          Again, we'll pick up on this in the Isomorphisms chapter.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the dihedral group <m>D_n</m> that we studied in the Symmetries chapter,
          which was the group of symmetries
          (rotations and reflections)
          of a regular <m>n</m> sided polygon.
          We determined in the latter part of that chapter that <m>D_n</m> was actually generated by the two elements <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>,
          satisfying the relations
          <md>
            <mrow>r^n \amp  = id</mrow>
            <mrow>s^2 \amp  = id</mrow>
            <mrow>srs \amp  = r^{-1}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any element of <m>D_n</m> can be written as <m>sr^k</m> for some integer <m>0 \le k \lt n</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The element <m>r</m> generates the cyclic subgroup of rotations,
          <m>R_n</m>, of <m>D_n</m>.
          Since <m>(sr^k)r(sr^k)^{-1} = sr^krr^{-k}s = r^{-1} \in R_n</m>,
          then by <xref ref="definition_Cosets_normal_alt">Definition</xref>
          the group of rotations is a normal subgroup of <m>D_n</m>;
          therefore, <m>D_n / R_n</m> is a group.
          Now there are <m>2n</m> symmetries in <m>D_n</m> and <m>n</m> rotations in <m>R_n</m>;
          so Lagrange's theorem tells us the number of cosets,
          <m>[D_n : R_n] = \frac{|D_n|}{|R_n|} = \frac{2n}{n} =2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>R_n</m>, the rotations,
          are one of the cosets, the reflections must be the other coset.
          So the group <m>D_n / R_n</m> boils down to to two elements,
          rotations and reflections, described by a <m>2 \times 2</m> Cayley table.
