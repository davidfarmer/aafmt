      In high school algebra, we learn that if <m>a\cdot b=0</m>,
      then either <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m>.
      This real number property is helpful when solving polynomial equations.
      We will see that ring elements do not
      <em>always</em> follow this rule.

          {zero_divisor} If <m>a,b\in R</m> with <m>a\neq 0,~b\neq 0</m>,
          and <m>ab=0</m>,
          then <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are called
          <term>zero divisors</term>.

    <p>
      Before looking at general properties of zero divisors,
      let's look at some examples.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Rings_Z21_zero_div">
      <statement>
        <p>
          In <m>Z_{21}</m>,
          <m>\{3,6,9,12,15,18,7,14\}</m> are all zero divisors, since:
          <m>3\cdot 7=6\cdot 7=9\cdot 7=12\cdot 7=15\cdot 7=18\cdot 7=14\cdot 3=0</m>.

          Find the zero divisors in <m>{\mathbb Z}_4</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z}_{15}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      In general, in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{p\cdot q}</m>,
      the elements <m>\{p,2p,\dots(q-1)p\}</m> and
      <m>\{q,2q,\dots (p-1)q\}</m> are all zero divisors.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Which of the following rings have zero divisors:
          <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>\mathbb{R}</m>,
          <m>\mathbb{C}</m>, and/or <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>

      The zero divisor property is closely related to invertibility,
      as shown in the following proposition.

    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Rings_zerodivisor">

          Then <m>a</m> is not a zero divisor<ndash/>in other words,

          {int_dom} A commutative ring that has no zero divisors is called an

    <p>
      <m>{\mathbb Z},~{\mathbb R},~{\mathbb C},~and~{\mathbb Q}</m> are all integral domains.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Rings_integral_domain">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m> is an integral domain if <m>p</m> is prime.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We have shown in <xref ref="example_Rings_Zn_ring">Example</xref>
          that <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m> is a commutative ring for all <m>p\in{\mathbb Z}</m>.
          It remains to show that <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m> has no zero divisors.
          We will show this by contradiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m> has a zero divisor
          <m>a\in{\mathbb Z}_p</m> such that <m>a\neq 0</m>.
          Then by <xref ref="definition_Rings_zero_divisor">Definition</xref>,
          there is some <m>b\in{\mathbb Z}_p</m> such that <m>b\neq 0</m> and <m>a\odot b=0</m>.
          So:
          <md>
            <mrow>\amp a\odot b=\bmod(ab,p)=0 \amp  \text{ Def. of } \odot</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp p \text{ divides }  ab \amp  \text{ Proposition }<xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmetic_equivalence_alt"></xref></mrow>
            <mrow>\amp p \text{ divides }  a \text{ or }  b \amp  \text{ Euclid's Lemma }</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          But how can <m>p</m> divide <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> when <m>p>a</m> and <m>p>b</m>?
          It is not possible.
          So our assumption that <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m> has a zero divisor <m>a</m> is false.
          So <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m> has no zero divisors and
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_p</m> is an integral domain.
        </p>
      </proof>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> is an integral domain.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="example_Rings_extension_ring">Example</xref>
          we showed that <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> is a ring.
          It remains to show that <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> is commutative and contains no zero divisors.
          We know that elements of <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> are real numbers,
          which are commutative by nature.
          Thus, <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> inherits commutativity from the real numbers.
          Additionally, real numbers have no zero divisors.
          So again, this property is inherited by
          <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> and we can conclude that
          <m>{\mathbb Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]</m> is an integral domain.

      An important property of integral domain is the cancellation law of multiplication,
      as shown in the following proposition.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Rings_cancellation_law">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given integral domain <m>D</m> and <m>a,b,c\in D</m>.

        <p>
          Since <m>D</m> is an integral domain,
          then <m>D</m> has no zero divisors.
          This means that <m>a=0</m> or <m>b-c=0</m>.
          But we know that <m>a\neq 0</m>.
          So <m>b-c=0</m> and <m>b=c</m>.

      In <xref ref="definition_Rings_principal_ideal">Definition</xref>
      we learned that a principal ideal is generated by a single element of a ring,
      <m>R</m>.
      We can now combine this idea with that of the integral domain.

          {princ_ideal_dom} A <term>principal ideal domain</term> is an integral domain,

      It turns out that <m>{\mathbb Z},~{\mathbb R},~{\mathbb C},~{\mathbb Q},~{\mathbb Z}_p,~{\mathbb R}[x],~{\mathbb C}[x],~{\mathbb Q}[x]</m>,
      and <m>{\mathbb Z}_p[x]</m> are all principal ideal domains.
      Unfortunately, we are not prepared to prove this here.<fn>
      The proof that <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is a principal ideal domain makes use of the

      All of the rings we have seen so far have multiplicative identities.
      But it is impossible to define multiplicative inverses for all the elements.
      In fact, it's (almost) <em>never</em>
      possible to have a multiplicative inverse of the additive identity
      (which we denote as 0),
      as long as the distributive property holds.

      We can extend the quaternion group by taking linear combinations of the elements of
      <m>{\mathbb Q}_8</m> with real coefficients.
      This new set, simply known as the <em>quaternions</em>,
      was discovered by William Rowan Hamilton of Dublin in 1843.
      Hamilton's quaternions, notated by <m>{\mathbb H}</m> in his honor,
      are widely used today in computer graphics to describe motion in three dimensional space and multiple antennae communications systems.
      We may define this set formally as follows.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {quaternionring} The set of real <term>quaternions</term>,
          denoted by <m>{\mathbb H}</m>, is defined by:
          <m>{\mathbb H}=\{a_0+a_1i+a_2j+a_3k:a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3\in {\mathbb R}\}</m>,
        </p>
        <p>
          where <m>i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <m>ij=-ji</m>, <m>ik=-ki</m>, and <m>jk=-kj</m>,
          so <m>{\mathbb H}</m> does <term>not</term>
          commute over multiplication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the distributive law and the commutative law of addition,
          we define addition on <m>{\mathbb H}</m> as follows.
          <men>
            \begin{aligned}\amp (a_0+a_1i+a_2j+a_3k)+(b_0+b_1i+b_2j+b_3k)\\ \amp =(a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)i+(a_2+b_2)j+(a_3+b_3)k. \end{aligned}
          </men>
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiplication of quaternions is also defined using the distributive law and commutative law of addition.

      We will begin by defining the <em>conjugates</em> in <m>{\mathbb H}</m>.
      (Note that the term <em>conjugates</em>,

          Show that <m>S</m> is a field.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We know from <xref ref="exercise_Rings_ringMatrices">Exercise</xref>
          that the set of all <m>2\times 2</m> matrices form a ring.
          It remains to show that <m>S</m> is a division ring with multiplicative commutativity.
          It will be important in our proof to know that <m>S</m> has the multiplicative inverse property.
          Let's show that first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>A\in S</m> be defined by <m>\begin{bmatrix}a \amp b\\ -b \amp a \end{bmatrix} </m>.
          Then <m>A^{-1}= \begin{bmatrix}\frac{a}{a^2+b^2} \amp -\frac{b}{a^2+b^2}\\ \frac{b}{a^2+b^2} \amp \frac{a}{a^2+b^2} \end{bmatrix}</m>
          (as long as <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are not both 0)
          because <m>A\cdot A^{-1}=A^{-1}\cdot A=1</m>.
          It should be clear that <m>A^{-1}\in S</m>.
          Thus every nonzero element of <m>S</m> has an inverse in <m>S</m> and the multiplicative inverse property holds.
          We are now ready to show that <m>S</m> is a division ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will show that <m>S</m> is a division ring by showing that it has no zero divisors.
          At this point,
          <xref ref="proposition_Rings_zerodivisor">Proposition</xref> comes in handy.
          We've already seen that every nonzero element <m>A \in S</m> has an inverse.
          <xref ref="proposition_Rings_zerodivisor">Proposition</xref>
          immediately tells us that <m>A</m> is not a zero divisor.
          Since <m>A</m> was an arbitrary element of <m>S</m>,
          then there are no zero divisors in <m>S</m> and <m>S</m> is a division ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have shown that <m>S</m> is a division ring,
          but we must now prove commutativity of multiplication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given <m>X= \begin{bmatrix}a \amp b\\ -b \amp a \end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>Y= \begin{bmatrix}c \amp d\\ -d \amp c \end{bmatrix} \in S</m>, then:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>X\cdot Y= \begin{bmatrix}ac-bd \amp ad+bc\\ -ad-bc \amp ac-bd \end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>Y\cdot X= \begin{bmatrix}ac-bd \amp ad+bc\\ -ad-bc \amp ac-bd \end{bmatrix} </m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have shown that <m>X\cdot Y=Y\cdot X</m> for any <m>X,Y\in S</m>,
          so <m>S</m> is commutative over multiplication.
          So <m>S</m> is a division ring with commutativity of multiplication,
          which means <m>S</m> is a field.
