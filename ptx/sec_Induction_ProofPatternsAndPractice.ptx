    <title>Induction proofs, type I: Sum/product formulas</title>
    <p>
      The most common, and the easiest,
      application of induction is to prove formulas for sums or products of <m>n</m> terms.
      Many of these proofs follow the same pattern.
      Here are some examples of formulas that can be proved by induction:
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\sum_{i=1}^n i(i+1)=\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{3}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\sum_{i=0}^n i! i = (n+1)!-1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\sum_{i=0}^n r^i=\frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r}</m> (<m>r\not=1</m>) (sum of finite geometric series)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\sum_{i=0}^n 2^i=2^{n+1}-1</m> (sum of powers of <m>2</m>)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following exercises, we will guide you through the proofs of (i) and
      (ii).
      For parts (iii) and (iv), you're on your own!
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Fill in the blanks for the following induction proof of formula (i) above.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We seek to show that, for all <m>n\in\NN</m>,
          <me>
            \sum_{i=1}^n i(i+1)=\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{3}. \tag{   \(P(n)\)}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Base case:</em> When <m>n=1</m>,
          the left side of <m>P(1)</m> is equal to
          <m>\underline{~\lt 1>~}</m> , and the right side is equal to
          <m>\underline{~\lt 2>~}</m> , so both sides are equal and <m>P(1)</m> is true.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Induction step:</em> Let <m>k\in\NN</m> be given and suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true.
          Then
          <md>
            <mrow>\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}i(i+1) \amp = \sum_{i=1}^{k}i(i+1) +\underline{~\lt 3>~}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\frac{k(k+1)(k+2)}{3} +\underline{~\lt 4>~} \text{ (by induction hypothesis) }</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\frac{(k+1)(k+2)(k+3)}{3}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, <m>P(\underline{~\lt 5>~})</m> holds,
          and the proof of the induction step is complete,
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Conclusion:</em> By the principle of induction,
          it follows that <m>\underline{~\lt 6>~}</m> is true for all <m>n\in\NN</m>.

    <title>Induction proofs, type II: inequalities</title>
    <p>
      A second general type of application of induction is to prove inequalities involving a natural number <m>n</m>.
      These proofs also tend to be on the routine side;
      in fact, the algebra required is usually very minimal,
      in contrast to some of the summation formulas.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases the inequalities don't
      <q>kick in</q>
      until <m>n</m> is large enough.
      By checking the first few values of <m>n</m> one can usually quickly determine the first <m>n</m>-value,
      say <m>n_0</m>,
      for which the inequality holds.
      Then one may use <m>n=n_0</m> as the base case, instead of <m>n=0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some examples of integer inequalities that can be proved using induction:
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          <p>

      In the following exercises, we will guide you through the proofs of (iii) and

          Fill in the blanks in the following proof of
          (iii).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We are trying to show that
          <me>
            n!>2^n \tag{\(P(n)\)}
          </me>
          holds for all <m>n\ge4</m>.
          (Note that the inequality fails for <m>n=1,2,3</m>.
          But this doesn't matter,
          because we only have to show that it works for for all <m>n</m> from <m>4</m> onwards.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Base case:</em> For <m>n=4</m>,
          the left and right sides of <m>P(4)</m> are equal to <m>\underline{~\lt 1>~}</m> and
          <m>\underline{~\lt 2>~}</m> , respectively, so <m>P(4)</m> is true.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Induction step:</em> Let <m>k\ge4</m> be given and suppose <m>\underline{~\lt 3>~}</m> is true.
          Then
          <md>
            <mrow>(k+1)!\amp =k! \cdot (k+1)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp >2^k \cdot \underline{~\lt 4>~} \qquad (\text{ by }  \underline{~\lt 5>~} )</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \ge 2^k\cdot 2 \qquad \qquad \text{ (since \(k\ge4\) and so \(k+1\ge2\))) }</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\underline{~\lt 6>~}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, <m>\underline{~\lt 7>~}</m> holds,
          and the proof of the induction step is complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Conclusion:</em> By the principle of induction,
          it follows that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n\ge4</m>.

    Extension of theorems from <m>2</m> variables to <m>n</m> variables</title>
    <p>
      Another very common and usually routine application of induction is to extend general results that have been proved for the case of <m>2</m> variables to the case of <m>n</m> variables.
      Below are some examples.
      In proving these results, use the case <m>n=2</m> as base case.
      To see how to carry out the general induction step
      (from the case <m>n=k</m> to <m>n=k+1</m>),
      it may be helpful to first try to see how get from the base case <m>n=2</m> to the next case <m>n=3</m>.

                  Applying the induction hypothesis to <m>x_1,\dots,x_k</m>,
                  we obtain that the product <m>\underline{~\lt 5>~}</m> is odd.

                <p>
                  Since <m>x_{k+1}</m> is <m>\underline{~\lt 6>~}</m> and,
                  by part (a) the product of two odd numbers is again odd,
                  it follows that <m>x_1x_2\dots x_{k+1} = (x_1\dots x_k)x_{k+1}</m> is odd.

                <p>
                  As <m>x_1,\dots,x_{k+1}</m> were arbitrary odd numbers,
                  we have proved <m>\underline{~\lt 7>~}</m>,
                  so the induction step is complete.

              <em>Conclusion:</em> By the principle of induction,
