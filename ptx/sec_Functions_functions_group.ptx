  <title>Do functions from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> form a group?</title>
  <p>
    At the end of the Sets chapter in <xref ref="sec_Sets_SetGroup">Section</xref>
    we considered the question, Do the subsets of a set form a group?
    Let's consider a similar question,
    but this time with functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall (once again) from <xref ref="subsec_ModularArithmetic_DefOfGroup">Section</xref>
    that a group is a set together with an operation defined on that set such that:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set is <em>closed</em> under the operation (in other words,
          the operation has the property of <em>closure</em>);
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set has a unique <em>identity</em>;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Every element of the set has its own <em>inverse</em>;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set elements satisfy the <em>associative property</em>
          under the group operation;
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    If we're going to make a group out the set of functions from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>,
    the first thing we need to do is define an operation.
    So far, the only operation we have on functions is composition.
    But this gives us a problem,
    because the composition of two functions that have the same domain and the same codomain isn't always well-defined:
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Give an example of sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> and two functions <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> and
        <m>g: A \rightarrow B</m> such that the composition <m>f \compose g</m> is
        <em>not</em> well-defined.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    For <m>f \compose g</m> to be well-defined,
    the domain of <m>f</m> must contain the range of <m>g</m>.
    We can guarantee this by taking <m>B=A</m>,
    so we consider only functions from a set <m>A</m> to itself:
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Functions_AAclosed">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given that <m>f: A \rightarrow A</m> and <m>g: A \rightarrow A</m>,
        show that <m>f \compose g</m> and
        <m>g \compose f</m> are both well-defined functions from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    <xref ref="exercise_Functions_AAclosed">Exercise</xref>
    confirms that the set of functions from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m> is closed under the operation of composition.
    So far, so good<ndash/>but we still have more fish to fry.
    We still need to find an identity for our set.
    This one's not hard:
    <xref ref="definition_Functions_identityMap">Definition</xref>
    gives us the identity map <m>\Id_A</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    That takes care of two group properties<ndash/>we have two more to go.
    Let's look at inverses.
    We've seen that not all functions have inverses under composition.
    So to make this part work,
    we'll have to further restrict ourselves to the set of <em>invertible</em>
    functions from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last thing we need to verify is the associtive property.
    Fortunately,
    you already showed that function composition is associative in <xref ref="exercise_Functions_func_comp_assoc">Exercise</xref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The foregoing discussion amounts to a proof of the following proposition.
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="proposition_Functions_functionGroup">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a set,
        and let <m>G</m> be the set of all invertible functions from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m>.
        Then <m>G</m> is a group under composition.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    In the following exercise we look at some particular sets of functions,
    and investigate whether or not these sets form groups under composition.
    Recall that to show whether or not a set with binary operation is a group,
    you just need to show the properties:
    closure, identity, inverse, and associative.
    We're lucky in this case that we don't have to prove associative in every single case,
    because the operation of function composition is always associative,
    as we've proven before.
    So it's enough just to prove closure, identity, and inverse.

    Finally, recall that some groups are commutative
    (commutative groups are also called
    <term>abelian</term> groups).
    Are groups under composition always abelian?
    Let's find out:
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Functions_abelian_ex">
    <statement>
      <p>
        For each of the examples in <xref ref="exercise_Functions_GpCompFun">Exercise</xref> which are groups,
        prove or disprove that the group is abelian.
        To check this, you just need to check whether or not the formula
        <m>f \compose g = g \compose f</m> for all <m>f,g</m> in the set.
        What this means is that if the group is not abelian,
        all you need to do is provide a single counterexample.
