  <title>Strong Induction, with applications</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      One of the most common applications of induction is to problems involving recurrence sequences such as the Fibonacci numbers,
      and to representation problems such as the representation of integers as a product of primes (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic),
      sums of powers of <m>2</m>
      (binary representation),
      and sums of stamp denominations
      (postage stamp problem).
    </p>
    <p>
      In applications of this type,
      the case <m>n=k</m> in the induction step is not enough to deduce the case <m>n=k+1</m>;
      one usually needs additional predecessors predecessors to get the induction step to work,
      e.g., the two preceding cases <m>n=k</m> and <m>n=k-1</m>,
      or <em>all</em> preceding cases <m>n=k,k-1,\dots,1</m>.
      This variation of the induction method is called
      <em>strong induction</em>.
      The induction principle remains valid in this modified form.

    <title>Strong induction and recurrences</title>
    <p>
      In the induction proofs we've looked at so far,
      we first had to prove a base case,
      and then used a preceding case (<m>n=k</m>) to prove the case <m>n=k+1</m> in the induction step.
      But when we aply induction to two-term recurrence sequences like the Fibonacci numbers,
      we'll need <em>two</em> preceding cases,
      <m>n=k</m> and <m>n=k-1</m>, in the induction step,
      and <em>two</em> base cases (e.g., <m>n=1</m> and <m>n=2</m>) to get the induction going.
      The logical structure of such a proof is of the following form:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Base step:</em> <m>P(n)</m> is true for <m>n=1,2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Induction step:</em> Let <m>k\in\NN</m> with <m>k\ge 2</m> be given and assume <m>P(n)</m> holds for <m>n=k</m> and <m>n=k-1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      [... Work goes here ...]
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore <m>P(k+1)</m> holds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Conclusion:</em> By the principle of strong induction,
      <m>P(n)</m> holds for all <m>n\in\NN</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that in the induction step, one could also say
      <q>Assume <m>P(n)</m> holds for `` <m>n=1,2,\dots, k</m></q>; this is a bit redundant as only the last two of the cases
      <m>n=1,2,\dots,k</m> are needed, though logically correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a worked-out example of a proof by strong induction.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a_n</m> be the sequence defined by <m>a_1=1</m>,
          <m>a_2=8</m>, and <m>a_n=a_{n-1}+2a_{n-2}</m> for <m>n\ge3</m>.
          Then <m>a_n=3\cdot 2^{n-1}+2(-1)^n</m> for all <m>n\in\NN</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We'll prove by strong induction that, for all <m>n\in\NN</m>,
        <me>
          \tag{\(P(n)\)} a_n=3\cdot 2^{n-1}+2(-1)^n
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Base case:</em> When <m>n=1</m>,
        the left side of <m>P(1)</m> is <m>a_1 =1</m>,
        and the right side is <m>3\cdot 2^{0}+2\cdot(-1)^1=1</m>,
        so both sides are equal and <m>P(1)</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <m>n=2</m>,
        the left and right sides of <m>P(2)</m> are <m>a_2=8</m> and <m>3\cdot 2^1+2\cdot(-1)^2=8</m>,
        so <m>P(2)</m> also holds.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Induction step:</em> Let <m>k\in\NN</m> with <m>k\ge2</m> be given and suppose <m>P(n)</m> is true for <m>n=1,2,\dots,k</m>.
        Then
        <md>
          <mrow>a_{k+1}\amp =a_{k}+2a_{k-1} \text{ (by recurrence for \(a_n\)) }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 3\cdot 2^{k-1}+2\cdot(-1)^k +2\left(3\cdot 2^{k-2}+2\cdot(-1)^{k-1}\right) \text{ (by \(P(k)\) and \(P(k-1)\)) }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 3\cdot \left(2^{k-1}+2^{k-1}\right) +2\left((-1)^k+2(-1)^{k-1}\right) \text{ (by algebra) }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 3\cdot 2^k+2(-1)^{k+1} \text{ (more algebra). }</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, <m>P(k+1)</m>) holds, and the proof of the induction step is complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Conclusion:</em> By the strong induction principle,
        it follows that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n\in\NN</m>.
      </p>

    <title>Strong Induction and representation problems</title>
    <p>
      For applications to representation problems one typically requires the induction hypothesis in its strongest possible form,
      where one assumes <em>all</em> preceding cases (i.e., for
      <m>n=1,2,\dots,k</m>) instead of just the immediate predecessor
      (as in simple induction)
      or two predecessors
      (as in strong induction applied to two-term recurrences).
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is a classic example of this type,
      a proof that every integer <m>\ge2</m> can be written as a product of prime numbers.
      This is the existence part of what is called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic;
      the other part guarantees uniquess of the representation,
      which we will not be concerned with here
      (it can also be proved by induction,
      but the proof is a little more complicated).
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall the definition of <em>prime</em>
      from <xref ref="ComplexNumbers">Chapter</xref>:
      an integer <m>n>1</m> is called <em>prime</em>
      if it has no factor greater than 1 other than itself.
      An integer <m>n>1</m> that is not prime is called <em>composite</em>:
          <idx><h>Composite number</h><h>definition</h></idx>
      in other words,
      <m>n</m> can be written as <m>n=ab</m> with integers <m>a,b</m> satisfying <m>2\le a,b\lt n</m>.
      Using these definitions, we may now state and prove:
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <em>(Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: existence)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Any integer <m>n\ge 2</m> is either a prime or can be represented as a product of
          (not necessarily distinct)
          primes, i.e., in the form <m>n=p_1p_2\dots p_r</m>,
          where the <m>p_i</m> are primes.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will prove by strong induction that the following statement holds for all integers <m>n\ge2</m>.
        <me>
          \text{ \(n\) can be represented as a product of one or more primes. } \tag{\(P(n)\)}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Base case:</em> The integer <m>n=2</m> is a prime since it cannot be written as a product <m>ab</m>,
        with integers <m>a,b\ge 2</m>,
        so <m>P(n)</m> holds for <m>n=2</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Induction step:</em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>k\ge2</m> be given and suppose <m>P(n)</m> is true for all integers <m>2\le n\le k</m>,
              i.e., suppose that all such <m>n</m> can be represented as a product of one or more primes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We seek to show that <m>k+1</m> also has a representation of this form.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>k+1</m> itself is prime,
              then <m>P(n)</m> holds for <m>n=k+1</m>, and we are done.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now consider the case when <m>k+1</m> is composite.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              By definition,
              this means that <m>k+1</m> can be written in the form <m>k+1=ab</m>,
              where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are integers satisfying <m>2\le a,b\lt k+1</m>,
              i.e., <m>2\le a,b\le k</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since <m>2\le a,b\le k</m>,
              the induction hypothesis can be applied to <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and shows that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> can be represented as products of one or more primes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Multiplying these two representations gives a representation of <m>k+1</m> as a product of primes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Hence <m>k+1</m> has a representation of the desired form,
              so <m>P(n)</m> holds for <m>n=k+1</m>,
              and the induction step is complete.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Conclusion:</em> By the strong induction principle,
        it follows that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n\ge2</m>,
        i.e., every integer <m>n\ge2</m> is either a prime or can be represented as a product of primes.
