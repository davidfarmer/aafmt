  <title>Permutation groups and other generalizations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We saw in the Symmetries chapter that the set of symmetries of any figure form a group under the operation of function composition.
      Since we've already seen that permutations are closely related to symmetries,
      this naturally leads to the question:
      is <m>S_X</m> a group under function composition?
      Fortunately, this time the answer is easier to prove.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Permutations_S_X_group">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given any set <m>X</m>, <m>S_X</m> is a group under function composition.
              <idx><h>Composition</h><h>of symmetries</h></idx>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            First then, if <m>f, g \in S_X</m>,
            then <m>f \compose g</m> would be,
            by definition of composition,
            a function from <m>X \to X</m>.
            Further, since it is a composition of two bijections,
            <m>f \compose g</m> would be a bijection
            (proved in Functions chapter).
            Therefore by definition <m>f \compose g</m> is permutation from <m>X \to X</m>.
            In other words <m>f \compose g \in S_X</m>.
            So <m>S_X</m> is closed under function composition.
              <idx><h>Composition</h><h>of permutations</h></idx>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Second, the identity of <m>S_X</m> is just the permutation that sends every element of <m>X</m> to itself (We will call this permutation <m>{\var id}</m>,
            just like we did with symmetries.)<idx><h>Permutation</h><h>identity</h></idx>.
              <idx><h>Identity</h><h>of a permutation</h></idx>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Third, if <m>f \in S_X</m>, then by definition <m>f</m> is a bijection;
            hence from the Inverse section of the Functions chapter we know <m>f</m> has an inverse <m>f^{-1}</m> from <m>X \to X</m> that is also a bijection.
            Hence <m>f^{-1} \in S_X</m>.
            Therefore every permutation in <m>S_X</m> has an inverse.
              <idx><h>Permutation</h><h>inverse</h></idx>
              <idx><h>Inverse</h><h>of permutations</h></idx>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Finally, composition of functions is associative,
            which makes the group operation associative.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hence <m>S_X</m> is a group under function composition.
      </p>

    <title>The symmetric group on <m>n</m> numbers</title>
    <p>
      We can label the vertices of a triangle as <m>A, B, C</m> or <m>1, 2, 3</m> or
      <m>\var{apple, pear,
      cherry}</m> or whatever, without changing the triangle.
      No matter how we label the triangle,
      the symmetries of the triangle will be the "same" in some sense
      (although we write them down differently).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since symmetries are special cases of permutations,
      this motivates us to investigate the effect of relabeling on permutations in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      For starters, we'll look at a simple example.
      Let <m>X = \{A, B, C, D\}</m> and <m>Y = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}</m>.
      Suppose
      <me>
        \mu = \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \amp  D\\ D \amp  C \amp  B \amp  A \end{pmatrix} ; \qquad \sigma = \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \amp  D\\ C \amp  D \amp  A \amp  B \end{pmatrix}
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        \tau = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \amp  4\\ 4 \amp  3 \amp  2 \amp  1 \end{pmatrix} ; \qquad \rho = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \amp  4\\ 3 \amp  4 \amp  1 \amp  2 \end{pmatrix}  \\
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Is <m>\mu = \tau</m>?
      Technically no, because they their domain/codomains are different,
      yet we can clearly see that they are somehow equivalent.
      But how do we express this equivalence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we start with the tableau for <m>\mu</m>.
      We cross out every <sq>A</sq> in the tableau and replace with <sq>1</sq>.
      Similarly, we replace <m>B, C, D</m> with <m>2, 3,4</m> respectively.
      Then what we end up with is exactly <m>\tau</m>.
      In other words, performing a
      <q>face-lift</q>
      on <m>\mu</m> gives <m>\tau</m>.
      Therefore <m>\mu</m> and <m>\tau</m> are equivalent,
      as are <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\rho</m>.

      Let's summarize our findings so far:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <em>sets</em> <m>S_X</m> and <m>S_Y</m> are equivalent in the following sense:
            for each element of <m>S_X</m> we can find an equivalent element of <m>S_Y</m> by replacing
            <m>A, B, C, D</m> with <m>1, 2, 3, 4</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Further, in the exercises we saw that the composition of two particular elements in <m>S_X</m> is equivalent to the composition of the two equivalent elements in <m>S_Y</m>.
            Although we've only shown this for two particular examples,
            it makes sense that the same thing would work no matter which two elements in <m>S_X</m> that we choose
            (after all, all we're doing is replacing letters with numbers<ndash/>and we're always replacing the same letter with the same number).
            So we can say that composition acts the
            <q>same</q>
            on both sets.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      So far we have only looked at sets with four elements.
      Now it's time to generalize these results to sets of any size.
      First, some notation:
    </p>
    <notation xml:id="order_y">
      <p>
        The <term>order of a set</term> <m>Y</m> is the number of elements of <m>Y</m>,
        and is written as <m>|Y|</m>.
            <idx><h>Order</h><h>of a set</h></idx>
        <fn>
        You're probably used to seeing
        <m>|\ldots|</m> as representing absolute value.
        Of course a set is not a number,
        so it has no absolute value.
        We use <m>|Y|</m> to denote order because it's a measure of the
        <em>size</em> of set <m>Y</m>,
        just as the absolute value of a number is the
        <q>size</q>
        of the number.
        </fn>
      </p>
    </notation>
    <p>
      Now let <m>X = \{1,2,\ldots,
      n\}</m>, and consider any set <m>Y</m> with <m>|Y| = n</m>.
      We could do a similar
      <q>face-lifting</q>
      as above to show that <m>S_X</m> is equivalent to <m>S_Y</m>.
      So the group <m>S_X</m> is equivalent to the permutations of <em>any</em>
      set of <m>n</m> elements.
    </p>
    <notation xml:id="sym_group_n_numbers">
      <p>
        Let <m>X=\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n\}</m>.
        Instead of writing <m>S_X</m>,
        we write <m>S_n</m> . <m>S_n</m> is called the
        <term>symmetric group</term>
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>symmetric</h></idx>
        on <m>n</m> numbers.

    <title>Isomorphic groups</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_Symmetry_UnexplainedMiracle">Section</xref>
      we compared the groups <m>\mathbb{Z}_n</m>,
      the <m>n</m> rotations of a regular n-gon,
      and the <m>n^{th}</m> roots of unity.
      We saw that,
      as long as you made a suitable pairing (bijection) between the elements of any two of these sets,
      then their Cayley tables were exactly the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've just seen the very same thing for <m>S_n</m>.
      If <m>|X| = |Y| = n</m> and we replace each of the elements in <m>X</m> with a corresponding element in <m>Y</m>,
      we concluded that the composition of <em>any</em>
      two elements in <m>S_X</m> is equivalent to the composition of the two equivalent elements in <m>S_Y</m>.
      That's exactly the same thing as saying that the Cayley table entries are equivalent between the two groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      This "equivalence of groups" is one of the premier concepts in abstract algebra,
      almost as important as the concept of a group itself.
      When two groups are equivalent like this,
      we say that they are <term>isomorphic groups</term>;
      we also say that the bijection that causes the groups to be equivalent is an <term>isomorphism</term>

      We will see in a later chapter how to show in general that two groups are isomorphic;
      but for now,
      forming the groups' Cayley Tables and seeing if you can match elements to make the tables the same is a very good strategy.

      Let's summarize this section so far.
      The permutations on a set <m>X</m> of <m>n</m> elements is a group under function composition
      (denoted by <m>S_n</m>).
      Further, for any figure with <m>n</m> sides,
      the symmetries of that figure is a subset of <m>S_n</m> containing at least the identity permutation,
      and that subset is itself a group under function composition.
      This example motivates the following definition.

      As the example shows,
      a permutation group need not comprise all symmetries of a figure or all rearrangements of a set.
      Many permutation groups have no evident practical interpretation whatsoever.
      Nonetheless they are still useful,
      because as we shall see they can be used to characterize the groups that contain them.
