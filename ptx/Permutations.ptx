      "For the real environment is altogether too big, too complex, and too fleeting for direct acquaintance. We are not equipped to deal with so much subtlety, so much variety, so many permutations and combinations. And although we have to act in that environment, we have to reconstruct it on a simpler model before we can manage it."

    <p>
      We mentioned at the beginning of the
      <q>Functions</q>
      chapter that we would be interested in functions on finite sets.
      In this chapter we will investigate the gory details of bijections
      (functions that are one-to-one and onto)
      whose domain and range are the same finite set.
      Until now we have looked at functions as a process, a machine;
      mappings that take set elements to other set elements.
      In this chapter,
      we will begin to consider functions as things, objects;
      as set elements <em>in their own right</em>.This new point of view will culminate in the realization that <em>all</em>
      finite groups are in some sense just groups of functions.
      You may not understand this yet,
      but don't worry<ndash/>you will by the end of the chapter!
