    <title>Decimal representation formula</title>
    <p>
      We are so used to writing decimal numbers,
      that we take for granted what we're doing.
      Let's think a little more carefully about what's really going on when we write a decimal number.
      Let's start with integers.
      Essentially,
      representing an integer as a decimal <idx><h>Decimal representation</h><h>of integers</h></idx> means writing writing the integer in terms of powers of 10.
      For example, the number 72483 means:
      <men>
        72483=7\cdot 10^{4}+2 \cdot 10^{3}+ 4 \cdot 10^2 + 8 \cdot 10^1 + 3 \cdot 10^0
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, a <m>m+1</m>-digit decimal number <m>n</m> which has digits <m>d_m</m>,
      <m>d_{m-1} \ldots d_0</m>
      (from largest to smallest)
      has the value:
      <men>
        n=d_{m}10^{m}+d_{m-1}10^{m-1}+\cdots+d_{0}
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that each digit <m>d_j</m> must be in <m>\mathbb{Z}_{10}</m>.

    <title>Formulas for decimal digits of of integers</title>
    <p>
      It is easy for a human being to identify the digits of a decimal number,
      because we're used to decimal arithmetic.
      But we want a way of <em>mathematically</em> defining the digits.
      This is useful when we need to have a computer recognize the decimal digits of a number
      (computers use <em>binary</em> rather than decimal numbers,
      so it takes some doing to get them to produce decimal digits).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's do this first with a simple example.
      We'll take our favorite number <m>n=72483</m>,
      and see if we can develop a mathematical process to read off the digits.
      The lowest digit (i.e. the number in the one's place) is found by taking the mod base 10:
      <m>3 = \bmod (n,10)</m>.
      Then if we subtract this digit from <m>n</m>,
      we get <m>72480</m>, which is divisible by 10.
      When we divide by 10, we obtain <m>7248</m>.
      Notice that the one's digit of this new number is equal to the 10's digit of <m>n</m>.
      So we can repeat the same process and take the modulus base 10 to obtain <m>8 = \bmod(7248,10)</m>.
      We then take <m>7248 - 8 = 7240</m>,
      divide by 10, and repeat the process until we get all the digits
      (from lowest to highest).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's generalize this to an arbitrary integer,
      <m>n</m> expressed in base <m>10</m>.
      The lowest digit (i.e. the number in the one's place) is found by calculating <m>\bmod (n,10)</m>.
      Let's call this <m>d_0</m>.
      We compute <m>(n-d_0)/10</m> which we will call <m>a_1</m>.
      The second digit <m>d_1</m> is equal to <m>\bmod(a_1,10)</m>.
      To obtain the third digit <m>d_2</m>,
      we first compute <m>a_2  = (a_1-d_1)/10</m> and then <m>d_2 = \bmod(a_2,10)</m>.
      From here, we will repeat the same steps to get the rest of the digits.
      We may summarize the entire process in the following series of equations:
      <md>
        <mrow>a_{0}=n\amp ;~~ d_{0}=\bmod(n,10)</mrow>
        <mrow>a_{1}=\frac{a_{0}-d_{0}}{10}\amp ;~~ d_{1}=\bmod(a_{1},10)</mrow>
        <mrow>a_{2}=\frac{a_{1}-d_{1}}{10}\amp ;~~ d_{2}=\bmod(a_{2},10)</mrow>
        <mrow>\vdots</mrow>
        <mrow>a_{m}=\frac{a_{m-1}-d_{m-1}}{10}\amp ;~~ d_{m}=\bmod(a_{m},10)</mrow>
      </md>,
    </p>
    <p>
      This sequence of <m>m+1</m> equations can be summarized as follows:
      <md>
        <mrow>a_{0}=n\amp ;~~ d_{0}=\bmod(n,10)</mrow>
        <mrow>a_{k}=\frac{a_{k-1}-d_{k-1}}{10}\amp ;~~ d_{k}=\bmod(a_{k},10), \qquad k = 1, \ldots m</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      These equation specify a <em>recursive process</em>
          <idx><h>Recursive process</h></idx>
      or <em>recursive method</em>,
      so called because we're repeating the same calculation again and again with the results of previous calculations.
      The neat thing is that we can use a similar process to find digits of numbers in other bases as well.
      We'll explain how this works in the next section.

    </exercise>
    <p>
      The above procedure can be long,
      particularly if we're trying to find <m>d_m</m> for a large value of <m>m</m>.
      Fortunately, there's a way to shortcut the process:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_ModularArithmeticBases_k_th-dig">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's find the digit <m>d_6</m> for the number <m>n=1928307465</m>
          (we may note in this case <m>d_6=8</m>).
          First, we can remove the digits above <m>d_6</m> digit taking <m>n</m> modulo <m>10^7</m>:
          <me>
            \bmod(n,10^{7})=8307465
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand,
          we can obtain all digits below <m>d_6</m> by taking <m>n</m> modulo <m>10^7</m>:
          <me>
            \bmod(n,10^{7})=307465
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now subtracting the two we get:
          <me>
            \bmod(n,10^{7}) - \bmod(n,10^{6})=8000000
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          From this point,
          we easily obtain <m>d_6</m> by dividing by <m>10^6</m>.
          So in summary, we have:
          <me>
            d_6 = \frac{\bmod(n,10^7)-\bmod(n,10^6)}{10^6}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      This formula can be generalized to find the digit <m>d_k</m> for any positive integer <m>n</m>:

    <title>Formulas for  decimal digits of nonintegers</title>
    <p>
      So far we've been talking about finding decimal digits of integers.
      What about other real numbers?
      Happily, it turns out there are similar formulas that work for any real number,
      as we will now show.
      To make things simple,
      in this section we will consider numbers between 0 and 1.
      Then for a general real number,
      we can separate it into its integer part and fractional part,
      and use our previous formulas for the integer part and the formulas in this section for the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numbers between 0 and 1 have a decimal expansion like integers do:
      <men>
        x=d_{-1}10^{-1}+d_{-2}10^{-2}+\cdots+d_{-k}10^{-k}+\cdots,  \text{  where }  d_{-j}\in \mathbb{Z}_{10}
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      Fractional numbers differ from integer in that the decimal expansion may be <em>infinite</em>,
      that is to say it may go on forever.<fn>
      In fact it is true that
      <q>almost all</q>
      numbers between 0 and 1 have infinite decimal expansions<ndash/>and yes,
      <q>almost all</q>
      has a mathematically precise definition!
      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's see if we can compute the <m>d_{-k}</m> digit of a decimal number less than 1.
      But first, let's recall some useful notation:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {floor} The <term>floor</term> is the highest integer less than or equal to the given decimal number,
          <m>x</m>, and is represented as <m>\lfloor x \rfloor</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Earlier, we used two methods,
      recursive method and a generalized formula,
      to find <m>d_k</m> of a decimal interger.We can do the same to find <m>d_{-k}</m> of the fractional part of a decimal number.
      We willl take the fraction representation of
      <m>x=0.17428</m> and find its third decimal digit, <m>d_{-3}</m>.
      This will be done using two different methods
      (just like we did with integers).
      First, we will use a recursive method,
      then we will find a direct formula.
      Let's begin with the recursive method,
      which gives us the digits one by one.
      We may notice that the first decimal digit of <m>x</m> is actually the integer part of <m>10x</m>:
      in other words, <m>d_{-1} = \lfloor 10x \rfloor</m>.
      We may subtract this from <m>10x</m> to obtain <m>b_{-1} = 0.7428</m>.
      Notice that <m>b_{-1}</m> contains all the digits of <m>x</m> except <m>d_{-1}</m>.
      So let's do it again.
      Multiplying <m>b_{-1}</m> by 10 and taking the floor, we obtain <m>d_{-2}</m>.
      Subtracting this from <m>10b_{-1}</m> gives us <m>b_{-2} = 0.428</m>.
      Once more should do it!
      Multiply <m>b_{-2}</m> by 10 and taking the floor gives <m>d_{-3} = 4</m>.
      Done!
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, the recursive process for finding <m>d_{-k}</m> is as follows:
      <men xml:id="eq_recursFrac">
        \begin{aligned}d_{-1}=\lfloor 10x\rfloor\amp ;~~ b_{-1}=10x - d_{-1}\\ d_{-2}=\lfloor 10b_{-1}\rfloor\amp ;~~ b_{-2}=10b_{-1} - d_{-2}\\ \vdots \\ d_{-k}=\lfloor 10b_{-k+1}\rfloor\amp ;~~ b_{-k}=10b_{-k+1} - d_{-k}\\ \vdots \end{aligned}
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      This process can take a very long time if we're trying to find <m>d_{-k}</m> for large values of <m>k</m>.
      Recall that formula <xref ref="eq_digit"/> gives an easy way of finding individual decimal digits of integers.
      Can we do the same thing for fractions?
      Yes we can!
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_ModularArithmeticBases_fracdigit">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find <m>d_{-3}</m> of the decimal number <m>x=0.17428</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we're looking for <m>d_{-3}</m>, Let's multiply <m>x</m> by <m>10^3</m>.
          <me>
            0.17428\cdot 10^3=174.28
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then take the floor:
          <me>
            \lfloor 174.28 \rfloor = 174
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, take the modulus base 10 (which is the 1's place of the number,
          as we've seen before):
          <me>
            \bmod(174,10)=4
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This gives us the correct value of <m>d_{-3}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      Let's recap the steps in <xref ref="example_ModularArithmeticBases_fracdigit">Example</xref>s:

    <title>Repeating decimals</title>
    <p>
      You have probably encountered fractions with infinite decimal expansions,
      such as <m>1/9 = 0.11111\ldots</m>,
      <m>1/11 = 0.09090909\ldots</m>,
      and <m>1/7 = 0.142857142857\ldots</m>.
      It is a strange and wonderful fact that these infinite decimal expansions always <em>repeat</em>:
      for example,
      the decimal expansion for <m>1/7</m> has the sequence <m>142857</m> that keeps on repeating.
      This observation suggests two questions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Why do decimal fractions repeat?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the period of repetition?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section we'll answer these two questions.
      But first we need to prove a preliminary proposition.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_ModularArithmeticBases_10power">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n>2</m> be an integer such that <m>\gcd(n,10)=1</m>.
          Then there exist a positive integer <m>m</m> such that <m>\bmod(10^{m},n)=1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Consider the infinite sequence:
        <m>\bmod(10,n)</m>, <m>\bmod(10^{2},n)</m>,
        <m>\bmod(10^{3},n),\dots</m>.
        All of these numbers are between <m>1</m> and <m>n-1</m>.
        Since the sequence is infinite and only can take at most <m>n-1</m> values,
        it follows there must be at least two values that are equal,
        so <m>\bmod(10^{k},n)=\bmod(10^{j},n)</m>, where <m>k>j</m>.
        But,
        <md>
          <mrow>\bmod(10^{k},n)\amp =\bmod(10^{j}\cdot 10^{k-j},n) \amp  \text{ [exponent rules] }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\bmod(10^{j},n)\odot \bmod(10^{k-j},n) \amp \text{ [<xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmetic_number_remainder">Proposition</xref>] } </mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\bmod(10^{k},n)=\bmod(10^{j},n)</m>,
        it follows by substitution that
        <me>
          \bmod(10^{j},n)=\bmod(10^j,n)\odot \bmod(10^{k-j},n)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Which implies <m>\bmod(10^{k-j},n)=1</m>.
        So if we set <m>m=k-j</m>,
        we have <m>\bmod(10^{m},n)=1</m>,
        and the proof is finished.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      <xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmeticBases_10power">Proposition</xref>
      leads to the following definition:
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          {orderMod10} Given a positive integer <m>n</m> with <m>\gcd(10,n)=1</m>.
          The smallest positive integer <m>m</m> such that <m>mod(10^{m},n)=1</m> is called the
          <term>multiplicative order</term> of <m>n \pmod{10}</m>).
        </p>
        <p>
          (Note that the order of <m>n</m> is guaranteed to exist because of <xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmeticBases_10power">Proposition</xref>).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

      We can now prove that a large class of fractions repeat,
      as follows:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_ModularArithmeticBases_gcd1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n>1</m> be a positive integer with <m>\gcd(10,n)=1</m>,
          and let <m>m</m> be the multiplicative order of
          <m>n \pmod{10}</m> . Then the decimal expansion of
          <m>\frac{1}{n}</m> repeats every <m>m</m> digits.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Given that <m>m</m> is the multiplicative order of <m>n</m> mod 10,
        from <xref ref="definition_ModularArithmeticBases_orderMod10">Definition</xref>,
        we get <m>\bmod((10^{m}-1),n)=0</m>.
        In other words, <m>10^{m}-1</m> is divisible by <m>n</m>,
        so that <m>\frac{10^{m}-1}{n}</m> is an integer.
        Letting <m>k=\frac{10^{m}-1}{n}</m>, it follows that:
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{1}{n}\amp =\frac{k}{10^{m}-1} \amp  \text{ substitution }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\frac{k}{10^{m}}\left(\frac{1}{1-10^{-m}}\right) \amp  \text{ factor }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =\frac{k}{10^{m}}\left(1+10^{-m}+\cdots\right) \amp \text{ geometric series }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp =k \cdot 10^{-m}+ k \cdot 10^{-2m}+\cdots  \amp \text{ distributive law and algebra }</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Next from the definition of <m>k</m>,
        we may conclude that <m>k \lt 10^m</m>
        (verify this).
        So <m>k\cdot 10^{-m}\lt 1</m>,
        and the nonzero decimal digits of
        <m>k\cdot 10^{-m}</m> are all contained in the first <m>m</m> decimal places to the right of the decimal point.
        Similarly, the nonzero decimal digits of
        <m>k\cdot 10^{-2m}</m> all lie within the second <m>m</m> decimal places
        (between the <m>10^{-m-1}</m> place and the <m>10^{-2m}</m> place),
        the nonzero decimal digits of
        <m>k\cdot 10^{-3m}</m> are all in the following <m>m</m> decimal places,
        and so on.
        In other words,
        the terms <m>k \cdot 10^{-m}, k \cdot 10^{-2m}, \cdots</m> are all within successive blocks of <m>m</m> digits.
        Thus <m>k</m> is the repeating sequence in the repeating decimal
        (possibly padded by some zeros,
        in case <m>k</m> has less than <m>m</m> nonzero digits),
        and that the fraction repeats every <m>m</m> digits.

    <title>Divisibility rules</title>
    <p>
      How do we know if a decimal integer,
      <m>m</m>, is divisible by an decimal integer, <m>n</m>?
      In this section we will be discovering the divisibility rules for different integers,
      <m>n</m>.
      We will start with finding the divisibility rule for <m>n=3</m>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_ModularArithmeticBases_234divby3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Is <m>234</m> divisible by <m>3</m>?
          Answering this question is equivalent to showing whether or not <m>\bmod(234,3)=0</m>.
          Let's first write the decimal representation of <m>234</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>234=200+30+4=2\cdot 10^{2}+3\cdot 10+4</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>\bmod(10,3)=1</m>, we get
          <md>
            <mrow>\bmod(234,3)\amp =\bmod(2 \cdot 10^{2}+3 \cdot 10+4,3) \amp  [\textrm{substitution} ]</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\bmod(2\cdot(1)^2+3\cdot(1)+4,3) \amp  [\textrm{Props. <xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmetic_remThm"></xref> and <xref ref="proposition_ModularArithmetic_number_remainder"></xref>} ]</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\bmod(9,3)=0 \amp  [\textrm{arithmetic} ]</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Let's generalize <xref ref="example_ModularArithmeticBases_234divby3">Example</xref>.
      Suppose we have a decimal number, <m>n</m>,
      with digits <m>d_{0}\dots d_{m}</m> so that the number can be written as <m>d_{m}d_{m-1}\dots d_{0}</m>.
      Then we can write
      <me>
        n=d_{m}\cdot 10^{m}+d_{m-1}\cdot 10^{m-1}+\dots +d_{0}\cdot 10^{0}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows that
      <md>
        <mrow>\bmod(n,3)\amp =\bmod(d_m\cdot 10^m+d_{m-1}\cdot 10^{m-1}+\dots +d_{0}\cdot 10^0,3)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\bmod(d_{m}+d_{m-1}+\dots+d_{0},3)=0</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This observation leads to the following proposition.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_ModularArithmeticBases_divisibility_by_3">
      <statement>
        <p>
          An integer is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

          which means that we can replace <m>10</m> with <m>-1</m> whenever we are taking mod's base 10.

    <proposition xml:id="proposition_ModularArithmeticBases_divisibility_by_11">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A number is divisible by <m>11</m> if and only if the

          (Note: alternating sums is where the signs of the number alternate when summing.)
        </p>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Given an integer with digits

          it follows that:
