      As we mentioned before,
      complex numbers got their start when mathematicians started considering the solutions to algebraic equations.
      One particularly important equation is
      <me>
        z^{n}=1, \qquad \text{ where }  n \in \mathbb{N}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      when <m>n=4</m> the complex numbers which solve <m>z^4=1</m> are <m>z=1</m>,
      <m>-1</m>, <m>i</m>, and <m>-i</m>.
      In general, the complex numbers that satisfy the equation <m>z^{n}=1</m> are called the
      <em><m>n</m>th roots of unity</em>.
          <idx><h>Roots</h><h>of unity</h></idx>
      (In other words,
      <q><m>n</m>th root of unity</q>
      means the same thing as ''<m>n</m>th root of 1''.)
    </p>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise_ComplexNumbers_48">
      <statement>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <p>

      It turns out that in general we can find <m>n</m> different <m>n</m>th roots of unity,
      as per the following proposition:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_ComplexNumbers_nth_roots_of_1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The complex number <m>z</m> is an <m>n</m>th root of unity if and only if <m>z</m> satisfies the following condition:
          <me>
            z=\cis\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right), \text{ where }  k \text{ is an integer between } 0 \text{ and }  n-1
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      To illustrate this proposition,
      consider the case <m>n=4</m>.
      Then the equation gives:
      <m>z=\cis(2k\pi/4)</m> where <m>k=0,1,2,3</m>,
      which works out to <m>\cis(0)</m>,
      <m>\cis(\pi/2)</m>, <m>\cis(\pi)</m>, and <m>\cis(3\pi/2)</m>.
      Converting to Cartesian form we get <m>1,
      i , -1, -i</m> as our four roots,
      in perfect agreement with what we found in the first paragraph of this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, let's give a proof!
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        The proposition is an
        <q>if and only if</q>
        assertion, meaning that we'll have to prove it both ways.
        We'll start with the
        <q>only if</q>
        part.
        To this end,
        we suppose <m>z</m> is a complex <m>n</m>th root of unity.
        Our goal is to show that <m>z</m> must satisfy the given formula.
        Any complex number may be written in polar form,
        so we may write <m>z = r \cis(\theta)</m> where <m>r</m> is the modulus and <m>\theta</m> is the complex argument of <m>z</m>.
        So we may deduce:
        <md>
          <mrow>z^n \amp = 1 \amp  (z \text{ is a }  n\text{ th root of unity } )</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp (r \cis(\theta))^n=1 \amp  (\text{ polar form of }  z)</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp r^n \cis(n\theta)=1 \amp  (\text{ de Moivre's theorem } )</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp |r^n \cis(n\theta)|=|1| \amp  (\text{ take modulus of both sides } )</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp |r|^n =1 \amp  (\text{ properties of modulus } )</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp r =1. \amp  (\text{ Since } r\text{ is a nonnegative number } )</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now substituting <m>r=1</m> back into the third line in this series of implications, we get:
        <md>
          <mrow>\cis(n\theta)\amp =1 \amp  (\text{ substitution } )</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp \cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta) =1 \amp  (\text{ definition of cis } )</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp \cos(n\theta)=1 \text{ and }  \sin(n\theta)=0 \amp (\text{ equality of complex numbers } )</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp n\theta = m \cdot 2\pi \amp \text{ (periodicity of sin and cosine, from trig) }</mrow>
          <mrow>\implies \amp \theta = m\cdot 2\pi/n. \amp \text{ (basic algebra) }</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        To recap, we have:
        <me>
          z= r \cis(\theta) \text{ where }  r=1 \text{ and }  \theta = 2\pi m/n, \text{ where } m \text{ is an integer }
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, any fraction of the form <m>m/n</m> can be written as an integer plus a fractional part between 0 and 1.
        Furthermore,
        the fractional part always has the form <m>k/n</m> where <m>k</m> is an integer between 0 and <m>n-1</m>.
        In other words:
        <me>
          m/n  = \ell + k/n \qquad \text{ where }  \ell \text{ and }  k \text{ are integers and }  0 \le k \lt  n
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows by substitution that
        <md>
          <mrow>z= \amp \cis(2\pi m/n)\amp \text{ (from last equality in previous series) }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  \implies z= \cis(2\pi (\ell + k/n))\amp \text{ (substitution) }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  \implies z= \cis(2\pi\ell) \cis(2\pi k/n)\amp \text{ (algebraic properties of cis) }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  \implies z=  \cis(2\pi k/n).\amp \text{ (def.  of cis and trig) }</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal has been achieved:
        <m>z</m> must definitely have the form
        <m>\cis(2\pi k/n)</m> where <m>0 \le k \lt n</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now for the
        <q>if</q>
        part; we must show that complex numbers which satisfy the formula as also <m>n</m>th roots of unity.
        By de Moivre's Theorem,
        <me>
          z^{n}=\cis\left(n\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right)=\cis(2k\pi)=1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finished!
      </p>
    </proof>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Note that the condition
        <me>
          z=\cis\left(\frac{2k\pi}{n}\right), \text{ where }  k \text{ is an integer between } 0 \text{ and }  n-1
        </me>.
        does indeed specify <m>n</m> distinct values for <m>z</m>.
        This is because <m>k/n</m> produces <m>n</m> different fractions between 0 and 1, so
        <m>\frac{2k\pi}{n}</m> gives <m>n</m> different angles between 0 and <m>2\pi</m>.
        Our vector representation of complex numbers tells us that different angles must produce different complex numbers.

      When represented in the complex plane,
      the roots of unity have some very interesting geometric properties:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_ComplexNumbers_rootsunity">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The 8th roots of unity can be represented as eight equally spaced points on the unit circle
          (<xref ref="fig_rtsunity">Figure</xref>).
          For example, some 8th roots of unity are
          <md>
            <mrow>\omega \amp  =\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i</mrow>
            <mrow>\omega^{3} \amp  =-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i</mrow>
            <mrow>\omega^{5} \amp  =-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i</mrow>

          <p>
            Every <em>rigid</em> motion of a regular <m>n</m>-gon is equivalent to some combination of complex conjugation and multiplication by one of the <m>n</m>th roots of unity.
            (By

            we mean any motion that a rigid object could undergo,
            without stretching or bending or distorting it in any way.

          <idx><h>non-abelian operations</h></idx>
      operations).
      We saw that both multiplication by a <m>n</m>th root of unity and complex conjugation corresponded to motions of a regular <m>n</m>-gon.
      However, the <em>order</em> of the motions matters:
      rotating first and then conjugating (i.e.
      <q>flipping</q>
      ) gives a <em>different</em> result than conjugating first,
      then performing the rotation afterwards.

      That is, given a complex number <m>a + bi</m>,
      can we find all solutions to the equation <m>z^n = a + bi</m>?
      Let's explore some simple cases first.

      Next, let us consider the case of cube roots.
      Consider for example the cube roots of <m>1 + i</m>,
      which are the solutions to
      <me>
        z^3 = 1 + i
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may rewrite this in polar form as
      <me>
        (r \cis \theta)^3 = \sqrt{2} \cis\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
      </me>,
      where <m>r \cis \theta</m> is <m>z</m> in polar form.
      De Moivre's theorem then gives us:
      <me>
        r^3 \cis 3\theta = \sqrt{2} \cis\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One solution for <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m> which satisfies this equation is:
      <me>
        r^3 = \sqrt{2} \implies r=2^{1/6}  \textrm{ and }   3\theta = \pi/4 \implies \theta = \pi/12
      </me>,
      so that
      <md>
        <mrow>z \amp =  2^{1/6} \cis(\pi/12)</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may use deMoivre's theorem to verify that this <m>z</m> is indeed a cube root of <m>1+i</m>.
      But is it the only one?
      In fact, if we multiply this <m>z</m> by
      <m>\cis(2 \pi/3)</m> and cube the result, we find:
      <md>
        <mrow>\left( 2^{1/6} \cis(\pi/12) \cdot \cis(2\pi/3) \right)^3 \amp = \left( 2^{1/6} \cis(\pi/12) \right)^3 \cdot \left(\cis(2\pi/3) \right)^3</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = (1+i) \cdot 1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 1+i</mrow>
      </md>,
      so that <m>z \cdot \cis(2\pi/3)</m> is also a cube root of <m>1+i</m>.
      Why does this work?
      Notice that <m>\cis(2\pi/3)</m> is a
      <em>cube root of unity</em>,
      so it turns into 1 when cubed.
      The same thing happens with <m>\cis(4\pi/3)</m>,
      which is the other cube root of unity<ndash/>you may check that
      <m>z \cdot \cis(4\pi/3)</m> is an additional cube root of <m>1+i</m>.
      This example suggests a general procedure for finding <m>3</m> distinct cube roots of complex numbers:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find a single cube root using de Moivre's Theorem;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Multiply your result by <m>\cis(2\pi/3)</m> and
            <m>\cis(4\pi/3)</m> to obtain <m>3</m> distinct cube roots.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      This takes care of cube roots.
      But let's not stop there!
      We can use a similar procedure to find <m>n</m> distinct <m>n</m>th roots of any complex number:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find a single root using de Moivre's Theorem;

        <li>
          <p>
            Multiply your result by all <m>n</m> roots of unity to obtain <m>n</m> distinct roots.

      Next we consider more general algebraic equations than the basic <m>n</m>th root equations we've been looking at so far.
          <idx><h>Roots</h><h>of polynomial equations</h></idx>
      As a first example, consider the equation <m>z^2 + pz = q</m>,
      where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are real numbers.
      Using the quadratic formula,
      it is not too hard to show that if <m>a + bi</m> is a solution of
      <m>z^2 + pz = q</m> then the complex conjugate <m>a - bi</m> is also a solution.
      This is because <m>z^2 + pz = q</m> can also be written as <m>z^2 + pz - q = 0</m>,
      and the quadratic formula tells us that there are two solutions,
      given by:
      <me>
        z = \frac{-p \pm \sqrt{p^2 - (4)(1)(-q)}}{2} = \frac{-p}{2}  \pm \frac{\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <m>-p/2</m> term is always real,
      but the square root term is either real or imaginary depending on the sign of <m>p^2 + 4q</m>
      (since <m>q</m> could be negative).
      If the square root term is real,
      then both roots are real, and each root is its own complex conjugate.
      If the square root term is imaginary,
      then the <m>\pm</m> means that the imaginary parts of the two roots are negatives of each other,
      so that the two roots are complex conjugates.

      The most famous result concerning complex roots of polynomials is known as the

    <p>
      The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra actually has two parts.
      The easy part is the
      <q>at most <m>n</m> distinct complex roots</q>
      part, and the hard part is the
      <q>at least one complex root</q>
      part.
      We will eventually prove the easy part in <xref ref="Polynomial">Chapter</xref>,
      but sadly the hard part is beyond our scope.

    <remark>
      <p>
        (<em>historical background</em>) The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is a famous
        <q>hard problem</q>
        in the history of mathematics.
        Some of the greatest mathematicians in history
        (including Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, and Gauss)
        thought they had proofs,
        only to have later mathematicians point out flaws or gaps in the arguments.
        See \url{http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Fund_theorem_of_algebra.html} for more details.
        In the modern mathematics curriculum,
        the proof is usually given in courses on complex analysis as an easy consequence of
        <q>Liouville's theorem</q>, which was first proved in 1847.
        Modern college students who learn basic concepts from the theory of complex variables can readily grasp the theorem which stymied the greatest mathematical minds of history.
