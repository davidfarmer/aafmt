    In this chapter,
    we have looked at the groups involved with symmetries of plane figures.
    But really, there is no need to restrict ourselves to two dimensions.
    Three-dimensional regular figures
    (such as the tetrahedron, cube,
    icosahedron, and dodecahedron)
    also have symmetry groups associated with them.We will say more about the symmetries of regular polyhedra in <xref ref="GroupActions">Chapter</xref>.

    Neither do we need to restrict ourselves to symmetries of objects.
    The symmetries of <em>patterns</em>
    also play an important role in art and architecture.
    For instance,
    every possible regular repeating pattern that can be put on wallpaper
    (or used as floor tiling)
    is associated with a symmetry group.
    It turns out that there are exactly 17 of these symmetry groups:
    they are called the <em>wallpaper groups</em>.

    For an excellent elementary reference on this subject, I highly recommend
    <q>17 Plane Symmetry Groups</q>
    by Anna Nelson, Holli Newman,
    and Molly Shipley, available on the web
    (as of January 2014)

    In physics, symmetry groups are used to describe the regular three-dimensional patterns associated with crystals.
    Many references for the crystallographic groups can also be found on the web:
    one I recommend is "Crystallographic Point Groups (short review)" by Mois I. Aroyo,
    available on the web at: \url{http://www.crystallography.fr/mathcryst/pdf/uberlandia/Aroyo_Point.pdf}.
