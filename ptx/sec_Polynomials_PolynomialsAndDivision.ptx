  <title>Polynomials and division</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far, we have looked at addition and multiplication of polynomials.
      We've also dealt with subtraction,
      because subtraction is simply addition of additive inverses.
      So it's only natural to consider the question of polynomial division.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've just mentioned that subtraction is the same as addition of additive inverses.
      Similarly, division is multiplication by multiplicative inverses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do polynomials have multiplicative inverses?
      Be careful here.
      In high-school algebra or in calculus,
      the polynomial <m>p(x)</m> has a perfectly good multiplicative inverse,
      namely <m>1/p(x)</m>.
      But <m>1/p(x)</m> is not a polynomial,
      so for us it doesn't count!

      In <xref ref="ModularArithmetic">Chapter</xref>,
      we used the following fact about integers:
      for any two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> with <m>b > 0</m>,
      then there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that <m>a = bq+r</m>,
      where <m>0 \leq r \lt b</m>.
      This fact was known to the ancient Greeks,
      who proved it using what's known as the
      <em>division algorithm</em>.<fn>
      As we said before, you may find a proof in any book on number theory.
      Or, take a look at: \url{http://2000clicks.com/mathhelp/NumberTh09EuclidsAlgorithm.aspx}.
      </fn> It turns out that a similar division algorithm<idx><h>Division algorithm</h><h>for polynomials</h></idx> exists for many types of polynomials.
      In this section we'll give the proof.
      But first, as usual, we look at some examples.

          Dividing polynomials in <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m> is very similar to long division of real numbers.
          For example,
          suppose that we divide <m>x^3 - x^2 + 2 x - 3</m> by <m>x - 2</m>.

        <p>
          In the example,
          we need to take the leading power term of <m>x</m> in the divisor and multiply by something that will make it equal to the the leading power term in the dividend.
          In this case it's <m>x^2</m>.
          This gives <m>x^2\cdot(x-2) = x^3 - 2x^2</m> Subtract from the dividend to yield a remainder of
          <m>x^2 + 2x - 3</m> and repeat until the remainder is of a degree less than the divisor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, <m>x^3 - x^2 + 2 x - 3 = (x - 2) (x^2 + x + 4 ) + 5</m>,
          which you may check by multiplying out the right-hand side.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      In <m>\mathbb{Z}_p[x]</m> the process of division is very similar.
      You may want to use a Cayley table for multiplication,
      to determine what terms go in the quotient.
      Additionally,
      when subtracting the product of the quotient and divisor from the dividend,
      each negative term must be replaced with its equivalent in <m>\mathbb{Z}_p</m>,
      which is the remainder mod <m>p</m>.

      We are now ready to prove the division algorithm for polynomials.
      In order to make our results as general as possible,
      we won't be too specific about the coefficients.In <xref ref="sec_Polynomials_PropertiesAndSigmaNotation">Section</xref>
      we gave five properties that our set of coefficients <m>R</m> should satisfy
      (including associativity, distributivity,
      and commutativity of addition).
      In this section we will refer to our set of coefficients as <m>F</m>,
      and we require that <m>F</m> have the same properties as <m>R</m> plus two more:
      <ol type="I">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>F</m> has a multiplicative identity (which we will denote as 1)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The nonzero elements of <m>F</m> have multiplicative inverses:
            that is, if <m>a \in F</m> and <m>a \neq 0</m>,
            then there exists an element
            <m>a^{-1} \in F</m> such that <m>a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = 1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      These properties are characteristic of a type of mathematical structure called a <term>field</term>.
      We'll study fields more extensively in <xref ref="Rings">Chapter</xref>:
      but for now,
      we simply recognize Properties (I)-(VII) as common properties of many

          {Division for Polynomials} <em>(Division algorithm for polynomials)</em>
          Suppose that the set <m>F</m> has addition and multiplication operations that satisfy (I)-(VII).
          Let <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> be nonzero polynomials in <m>F[x]</m>,
          where the degree of <m>g(x)</m> is greater than 0.
          Then there exist unique polynomials <m>q(x)</m> and <m>r(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m> such that
          <me>
            f(x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x)
          </me>,
          where the degree of <m>r(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>g(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will first prove the existence of <m>q(x)</m> and <m>r(x)</m>.
        We define a set <m>S</m> as follows:
        <me>
          S = \{f(x) - g(x) h(x), \text{ for all }  h(x) \in F[x] \}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This set is nonempty since <m>f(x) \in S</m>.
        Let <m>r(x)</m> be a polynomial of smallest degree in <m>S</m>.<fn>
        At this point we can't assume that there's only one such polynomial,
        so we have to say
        <q>a polynomial</q>
        rather than
        <q>the polynomial</q>.
        </fn> This means that there must exist a <m>q(x)</m> such that
        <me>
          r(x) = f(x) - g(x) q(x)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to show that the degree of <m>r(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>g(x)</m>.
        Let's prove this by contradiction.
        So we assume the contrary, namely that <m>\deg g(x) \leq \deg r(x)</m>.
        Let <m>n,m</m> be the degree of
        <m>g(x),r(x)</m> respectively, where <m>n \leq m</m>.
        Then we may write
        <me>
          g(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n
        </me>
        and
        <me>
          r(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_m x^m
        </me>,
        where <m>a_n \neq 0</m> and <m>b_m \neq 0</m>.
        Taking a cue from the process of long division,
        we define a new polynomial <m>r'(x)</m> by
        <md>
          <mrow>r'(x) := r(x) - b_m a_n^{-1} x^{m-n}g(x)</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's tedious to write out all the terms of <m>r'(x)</m>.
        Fortunately, it's not really necessary.
        We only need to remark that the degree of <m>r'(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>r(x)</m>,
        since the leading-order terms of <m>r(x)</m> and
        <m>b_m(a_n^{-1}) x^{m-n}g(x)</m> are both <m>b_m x^m</m>,
        so they cancel.
        We may plug in <m>r(x) = f(x) - g(x) q(x)</m> to obtain
        <md>
          <mrow>r'(x) \amp :=  f(x) - g(x) q(x) - b_m a_n^{-1}  x^{m-n}g(x)</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = f(x) - g(x) \left( q(x) - b_m a_n^{-1}  x^{m-n}\right)</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shows that <m>r'(x)</m> is also in <m>S</m>
        (look back at the definition and see!).
        But <m>\deg r'(x) \lt \deg r(x)</m>,
        which contradicts our condition that <m>r(x)</m> is an element of <m>S</m> with smallest degree.
        The rules of proof by contradiction allow us to conclude that our assumption is false:
        namely, it must be true that <m>\deg g(x) > \deg r(x)</m>.
        This finishes the proof of existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        To show that <m>q(x)</m> and <m>r(x)</m> are unique,
        suppose that polynomials <m>q'(x)</m> and <m>r'(x)</m> satisfy <m>f(x) = g(x) q'(x) + r'(x)</m>, so that
        <me>
          f(x) = g(x) q(x) + r(x) = g(x) q'(x) + r'(x)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This implies
        <me>
          g(x) [q(x) - q'(x) ] = r'(x) - r(x)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>q(x) - q'(x)</m> is not the zero polynomial,
        then since the field <m>F</m> has no zero divisors it follows that <m>\deg( g(x)) \leq \deg( g(x) [q(x) - q'(x) ])</m>.
        This in turn implies
        <me>
          \deg g(x) \leq \deg( g(x) [q(x) - q'(x) ] )= \deg( r'(x) - r(x) )
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the degrees of both <m>r(x)</m> and <m>r'(x)</m> are strictly less than the degree of <m>g(x)</m>,
        so their difference can't have such a large degree.
        It follows that <m>q(x) - q'(x) = 0</m>,
        which implies that <m>q(x)=q'(x)</m> and <m>r(x)=r'(x)</m>.

    <title>Greatest common divisors of polynomials</title>
    <p>
      In the Modular Arithmetic chapter,
      we used the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd's of sets of integers.
      Now that we have a division algorithm for polynomials,
      we can find gcd's of polynomials in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate this, we begin with an example in <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m>.

          Furthermore, any real,
          nonzero multiple of <m>6x^2 -6</m> will divide both <m>a(x)</m> and <m>b(x)</m>.
          For convenience,
          we choose the multiple with a leading coefficient of 1.
          This means that <m>x^2-1</m> is the gcd of <m>a(x)</m> and <m>b(x)</m>.
          You should check that <m>x^2-1</m> divides both <m>a(x)</m> and <m>b(x)</m>.

      When you first learned about factoring polynomials with integer or real coefficients,
      you may have been told
      (or noticed on your own)
      that a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> has at most <m>n</m> roots.
      This result is important enough that it has a name:
      it's part of the <term>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</term>,
      or <term>FTOA</term><nbsp/>for short
      (sadly, it's only the easy part of FTOA<ndash/>we'll discuss the hard part later).
    </p>
    <p>
      Most likely though you've never seen a proof of the FTOA. No worries<ndash/>the proof is at hand!
      In keeping with our previous discussion,
      we will state our results in terms of <m>F[x]</m>,
      where the set of coefficients <m>F</m> satisfies properties (I)-(VII).
    </p>
    <p>
      The following preliminary proposition gives us a way to relate polynomial values to polynomial remainders.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Polynomials_polyremainder">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F</m> satisfy properties (I)-(VII), <m>f(x) \in F[x]</m>,
          and <m>a \in F</m>.
          When <m>f(x)</m> is divided by <m>x-a</m>,
          the remainder is <m>f(a)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        According to <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_Division_for_Polynomials">Proposition</xref>,
        if we divide <m>f(x)</m> by <m>x-a</m>,
        it will produce two unique polynomials <m>q(x)</m> and <m>r(x)</m> such that <m>f(x) = (x-a)q(x) + r(x)</m>.
        Since the degree of <m>x-a</m> is 1, then according to the division algorithm,
        the degree of <m>r(x)</m> must be less than 1.
        Therefore <m>r(x)</m> must be a constant <m>r</m>, and we may write:
        <me>
          f(x) = (x-a)q(x) + r
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we set <m>x=a</m> then we get:
        <md>
          <mrow>f(a) \amp = (a-a)q(x) + r</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = 0 \cdot q(x) + r</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = r</mrow>
        </md>.

      We will need to take care of some preliminaries in order to prove
      (the easy part of)
      the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
      From basic algebra with real numbers,
      we know that if <m>ab=0</m> then either <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m>
      (see also <xref ref="proposition_ComplexNumbers_nonzero_complex_product">Proposition</xref>
      of <xref ref="ComplexNumbers">Chapter</xref>).
      Actually, this <term>zero-divisor property</term>
      hold for any set <m>R</m> that satisfies (I)-(VII):

    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Polynomials_noZeroDiv">

      It turns out that if <m>F</m> satisfies the zero-divisor property,
      then <m>F[x]</m> satisfies the same property:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Polynomials_polyremainder2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>F</m> satisfies Properties (I)-(VII), and suppose <m>p(x),
          q(x) \in F[x]</m>.
          Then <m>p(x) q(x)=0</m> iff either <m>p(x)=0</m> or <m>q(x)=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since this is a
        <q>iff</q>
        proof, we must actually prove both the
        <q>if</q>
        ' statement and the
        <q>only if</q>
        statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        First we prove the
        <q>if</q>
        part.
        It follows from the formula for multiplication of polynomials that if either <m>p(x)=0</m> or <m>q(x)=0</m>,
        then the product <m>p(x)q(x)</m> must also be 0.
        That was easy!
      </p>
      <p>
        The
        <q>only if</q>
        part is harder.
        We will prove the contrapositive,
        namely that <m>p(x)\neq\ 0</m> and
        <m>q(x)\neq\ 0</m> implies that <m>p(x)q(x) \neq 0</m>.
        Let
        <me>
          p(x) =  \sum_{i=0}^{m} a_i x^i \mathrm{~ and ~} q(x) =  \sum_{j=0}^{n} b_j x^j
        </me>,
        where <m>a_m \neq\ 0</m> and <m>b_n\neq\ 0</m>.
        We can then write
        <me>
          p(x) q(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{m+n} c_k, \mathrm{~~where~~} c_{k} =  \sum_{i=0}^{k}a_i b_{k-i}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the coefficient <m>c_{m+n}</m>,
        which may be expanded out as
        <me>
          c_{m+n} =  a_0 b_{m+n} + a_1 b_{m+n-1} + \ldots  + a_{m}b_{n} + \dots +  a_{n+m-1}b_{1} + a_{n+m}b_{0}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a look at these terms for a moment.
        Which of them are nonzero?
        Notice how we've separated out the term
        <m>a_{m}b_{n}</m> in the middle of the expansion.
        Since <m>a_{m} \neq 0</m> and
        <m>b_{n} \neq 0</m>, this term is nonzero.
        Now, are there any other nonzero terms?
        All terms have the form <m>a_i b_j</m>,
        and for every other term in the series
        (besides <m>a_{m}b_{n}</m>)
        we have either <m>i>m</m> or <m>j>n</m>.
        If <m>i>m</m> then <m>a_i=0</m>,
        since the degree of <m>p(x)</m> is <m>m</m> and all coefficients of terms of higher degree are 0.
        For the same reason, if <m>j>n</m> then <m>b_j=0</m>.
        It follows that except for the term <m>a_{m}b_{n}</m>,
        all other terms <m>a_ib_j</m> are 0, which implies that <m>c_{m+n} = a_mb_n \neq 0</m>.
        But this means that <m>p(x)q(x)</m> has a nonzero term,
        namely <m>c_{m+n}x^{m+n}</m>,
        so <m>p(x)q(x) \neq 0</m>.
        The proof is completed.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      And here's the result we've been waiting for.
      Now that we've prepared the ground,
      it's not so difficult to prove.

          (<em>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:

          Then the equation <m>f(x)=0</m> has at most <m>n</m> solutions:
          that is, there are at most <m>n</m> distinct elements
          <m>\{x_1,\ldots x_n\}</m> of <m>F</m> such that
          <m>f(x_m)=0</m> for <m>1 \le m \le n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>a_1</m> is a solution to <m>f(x)=0</m>.
        Then by <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_polydivides">Proposition</xref>
        it follows that <m>x-a_1</m> divides <m>f(x)</m>.
        Therefore <m>f(x) = (x-a_1) g_{n-1}(x)</m> where the degree of <m>g_{n-1}(x)=n-1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now if <m>a_2 \neq a_1</m> is another solution then using our above result we have
        <me>
          f(a_2) = (a_2 - a_1)g_{n-1}(a_2) = 0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>a_2 - a_1 \neq 0</m>,
        it follows that <m>g_{n-1}(a_2) = 0</m>.
        So we can write <m>g_{n - 1}(x) = (x-a_2)g_{n-2}(x)</m> where the degree of <m>g_2(x) = n-2</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuing in the same way,
        if there are distinct roots <m>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</m> then
        <me>
          f(x) = (x - a_1)(x - a_2)...(x - a_n)g_0
        </me>,
        where the degree of <m>g_0</m> is 0
        (in other words, <m>g_0</m> is a constant.).
        So there can't be any more solutions, <m>a_{n+1}</m>,
        because <m>(x-a_{n+1})</m> doesn't divide <m>g_0</m>.

      Take note of the
      <q>at most</q>
      qualification in <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_FTOA">Proposition</xref>.
      There are cases of polynomials in <m>F[x]</m> which do not have
      <em>any</em> roots in <m>F</m>.
      For example, there are polynomials in
      <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m> that have no roots at all in <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m>,
      as the next examples illustrate.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Polynomials_poly_complex">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the roots of <m>p(x)=2x^2+2x+5</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this is a quadratic polynomial we can use the famous quadratic formula:
          <me>
            x=\frac {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In <m>p(x), a=2, b=2</m>, and <m>c=5</m>.
          We substitute those values into the formula and obtain the following:
          <md>
            <mrow>x\amp =\frac {-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2-4\cdot 2\cdot 5}}{2\cdot 2}=\frac {-2 \pm \sqrt{-36}}{4}=\frac {-2 \pm 6i}{4}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\frac {-1 \pm 3i}{2}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the roots of <m>p(x)</m> are <m>x</m> ={<m>-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{3}{2}i, -\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{2}i</m>}. Neither of these roots are elements of <m>{\mathbb R}</m>.
          As noted above this does not contradict FTOA, which only guarantees there won't be more than 2 roots.
        </p>

    </example>
    <p>
      The next example is a cubic polynomial in <m>\mathbb{Z}[x]</m>.
      To find the rational roots, we will make use of the following proposition.
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Polynomials_Rationalroots">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x) = a_{n}x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{0}</m> be a polynomial in <m>\mathbb{Z}[x]</m>.
          Any rational roots of <m>f(x)</m> expressed in lowest terms have numerators,
          <m>p</m>,
          which are factors of <m>a_{0}</m> and denominators, <m>q</m>,
          which are factors of <m>a_{n}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(x) = a_{n}x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{0}</m> be a polynomial in
        <m>\mathbb{Z}[x]</m> and suppose that <m>p/q</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m>,
        where the fraction <m>p/q</m> is in lowest terms
        (so <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are relatively prime).
      </p>
      <p>
        First we will show that <m>p</m> is a factor of <m>a_{0}</m>.
        Since <m>p/q</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m> we have <m>f\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)=0</m>,
        which implies
        <me>
          a_{n}\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)^n+a_{n-1}\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)^{n-1}+...+a_{0}=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiplying both sides by <m>q^n</m>, we have,
        <me>
          \left(a_{n}\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)^n+a_{n-1}\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)^{n-1}+...+a_{0}\right)q^n=0
        </me>,
        which simplifies to
        <me>
          a_{n}p^n+a_{n-1}(p^{n-1}q)+...+a_{0}q^n=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This expression can be rearranged to obtain:
        <me>
          p\left(-a_{n}p^{n-1}-a_{n-1}(p^{n-2}q)-...-a_{1}q^{n-1}\right)=a_{0}q^n
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]</m>,
        all the coefficients <m>a_i</m> are also integers.
        <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are also integers.
        Since integers are closed under addition and multiplication,
        it follows that both sides of the above equation are integers.
        Since <m>p</m> divides the left-hand side,
        it must also divide the right-hand side.
        Therefore <m>p</m> divides <m>a_{0}q^n</m>.
        Now <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are relatively prime:
        so in order for <m>p</m> to divide <m>a_{0}q^n</m>,
        it must divide <m>a_0</m>.
        In other words,
        <m>p</m> is a factor of <m>a_{0}</m><mdash/>which is just what we wanted to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out the proof that <m>q</m> is a factor of <m>a_{n}</m> is basically the same,
        if we use a little trick.
        The first equation that we wrote down above was:
        <me>
          a_{n}\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)^n+a_{n-1}\left(\frac {p}{q}\right)^{n-1}+...+a_{0}=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's multiply both sides by <m>(q/p)^n</m>.
        After simplifying, and rearranging we get:
        <me>
          a_{0}\left(\frac {q}{p}\right)^n+a_{1}\left(\frac {q}{p}\right)^{n-1}+...+a_{n}=0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, this new equation corresponds exactly to the first equation with the following replacements:
        <me>
          a_n  \rightarrow a_0;\,\, a_{n-1} \rightarrow a_1;\,\, \ldots;\,\, a_0 \rightarrow a_n; \,\, p  \leftrightarrow q
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can then go through the entire previous argument,
        making these replacements.
        We concluded previously that <m>p</m> is a factor of <m>a_0</m><mdash/>so if we apply the identical argument to the equation with replacements,
        we obtain that <m>q</m> is a factor of <m>a_n</m>.
        You may fill in the details in the following exercise.
      </p>
      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Starting with the equation <m>a_{0}\left(q/p\right)^n+a_{1}\left(q/p\right)^{n-1}+...+a_{n}=0</m>,
            give the complete argument which shows that <m>q</m> is a factor of <m>a_n</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </exercise>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Now let's get some practice using <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_Rationalroots">Proposition</xref>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the roots of <m>f(x)=3x^3+10x^2+11x+6</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this is a cubic polynomial,
          we can't use the quadratic formula,
          at least not to begin with.
          The coefficients are integers,
          so we may use <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_Rationalroots">Proposition</xref>,
          which says that <em>any</em> rational roots of <m>p(x)</m> have numerators that are factors of <m>a_{0}</m> and denominators that are factors of <m>a_{n}</m>.
          This does not guarantee that there are rational roots:
          sometimes polynomials are irreducible,
          but we still try every method possible to find those roots unless we know that we can't reduce the polynomial.
          So we will proceed with trying to find the roots of <m>f(x)</m> using <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_Rationalroots">Proposition</xref>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <m>f(x)</m>, possible numerators of any rational roots are:
          <m>p=\pm1, \pm2, \pm3, \pm6</m>.
          The possible denominators are: <m>q=\pm1, \pm3</m>.
          So we have as possible rational roots the following:
          <m>p/q= \pm1, \pm\frac{1}{3}, \pm2, \pm\frac{2}{3},\pm3, \pm6</m>.
          By <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_polydivides">Proposition</xref>,
          if <m>f(p/q)=0</m> then <m>(x-p/q)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>;
          which would make <m>p/q</m> a root of <m>f(x)</m>.
          After testing all possibilities we find the following rational root:
          <m>f(-2)=3(-2)^3+10(-2)^2+11(-2)+6=0</m>.
          Therefore, <m>x=-2</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>(x+2)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>.
          We then use long division to factor <m>f(x)</m>.

      But the proposition can't guarantee the existence of even one root<ndash/>and we've shown in <xref ref="example_Polynomials_poly_complex">Example</xref>
      that there may be no roots at all!

          Give an example of a polynomial in <m>{\mathbb Q}[x]</m> which has roots in

      For some special cases of <m>F</m> however,
      a nonconstant polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> (i.e. a polynomial with degree 1 or more) always has roots in <m>F</m>.
      As a lead-in,
      we may notice that for every nonconstant polynomial in
      <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m> that we looked at we were always able to find complex roots,
      even when weren't able to find real roots.
      This might lead us to conjecture that every nonconstant polynomial in
      <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m> has at least one root in <m>\mathbb{C}</m>.
      The hard part of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra affirms that this is true.
      What's more,
      not just nonconstant polynomials in <m>\mathbb{R}[x]</m>,
      but also those in <m>\mathbb{C}[x]</m> all have at least one in <m>\mathbb{C}</m>.

          Let's do another example,
          but this time with a quadratic trinomial in <m>\mathbb{C}[x]</m>.
          Let <m>p(x)=(1+i)x^2+(2-i)x+(3+3i)</m>.
          Find the roots of <m>p(x)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this is a quadratic polynomial we can use the quadratic formula and obtain the following:
          <md>
            <mrow>x=\amp \frac {-(2-i) \pm \sqrt{(2-i)^2-4(1+i)(3+3i)}}{2(1+i)}=\frac {(-2+i) \pm \sqrt{3-4i-24i}}{(2+2i)}</mrow>
            <mrow>=\amp \frac {(-2+i) \pm \sqrt{3-28i}}{(2+2i)}=\frac {(-2+i) \pm \sqrt{3-28i}}{(2+2i)}\cdot \frac {2-2i}{2-2i}</mrow>
            <mrow>=\amp \frac{6+6i\pm (2-2i)\sqrt{3-28i}}{8}=\frac{3+3i\pm (1-i)\sqrt{3-28i}}{4}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the two roots are <m>x=\left\{\frac{3+3i- (1-i)\sqrt{3-28i}}{4}, \frac{3+3i+ (1-i)\sqrt{3-28i}}{4}\right\}</m>.

        <p>
          Any polynomial <m>p(x)</m> of degree <m>n</m> in
          <m>\mathbb{C}[x]</m> can be completely factored as a constant times a product of <m>n</m> linear terms,
          as follows:
          <men>
            p(x) = b(x -a_1)(x-a_2) \ldots (x - a_n)
          </men>.
          where <m>b, a_1, \ldots, a_n \in {\mathbb C}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>p(x)</m> be an arbitrary polynomial of degree <m>n</m> in <m>\mathbb{C}[x]</m>.
        By <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_FTOAhard">Proposition</xref>,
        <m>p(x)</m> has at least one complex root <m>a</m>.
        So <m>(x-a)</m> is a factor of <m>p(x)</m> and we can write <m>p(x)=(x-a_1)p_1(x)</m>;
        where the degree of <m>p_1(x)</m> is <m>n-1</m>.
        If <m>p_1(x)</m> is linear,
        then we are done, but if <m>p_1(x)</m> is not linear,
        then by <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_FTOAhard">Proposition</xref>
        it also has a complex root <m>a_2</m>.
        So <m>(x-a_2)</m> is a factor of <m>p_2(x)</m> and we can write <m>p(x)=(x-a_1)(x-a_2)p_2(x)</m>;
        where the degree of <m>p_2(x)</m> is <m>n-2</m>.
        The same argument continues until we reach <m>p_{n-2}(x)</m>,
        which has degree 1.
        But this means that <m>p_{n-2}(x)</m> can be written as <m>bx - c</m>,
        which we may rewrite as <m>b(x-a_n)</m>, where <m>a_n = c/b</m>.
        It follows finally that <m>p(x) =b (x-a_1)(x-a_2) \ldots (x-a_n)</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>p(x)</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> such that the coefficient of <m>x^n</m> is 1
          (such a polynomial is called a <term>monic polynomial</term>).
              <idx><h>Polynomial</h><h>monic</h></idx>
          Show that for a monic polynomial,
          the coefficient <m>b</m> in <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_complexlinear">Proposition</xref> is equal to 1.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      Now let's apply <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_complexlinear">Proposition</xref> to an example.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x)=x^4-4x^3+10x^2-24x+24</m> be a polynomial in <m>\mathbb{C}[x]</m>.
          Notice that the coefficients of <m>f(x)</m> are integers,
          so <m>f(x)</m> is also in <m>\mathbb{Z}[x]</m>.
          Therefore we can use <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_Rationalroots">Proposition</xref>
          to factor out our first linear term.
          Since <m>a_0=24</m> and <m>a_n=1</m>,
          possible rational roots are
          <me>
            \frac{p}{q}= \pm1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4,\pm 6, \pm 8, \pm 12
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_polydivides">Proposition</xref>,
          if <m>f(p/q)=0</m> then <m>(x-p/q)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m> i.e.
          <m>p/q</m> a root of <m>f(x)</m>.
          After testing all possibilities we find the following rational root:
          <m>f(2)=2^4-4(2)^3+10(2)^2-24(2)+24=0</m>.
          Therefore, <m>x=2</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>(x-2)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>.
          After dividing <m>f(x)</m> by <m>(x-2)</m> we have the following:
          <md>
            <mrow>f(x)=\amp  (x-2)(x^3-2x^2+6x-12)=(x-2)(x^2(x-2)+6(x-2))</mrow>
            <mrow>=\amp (x-2)(x-2)(x^2+6)=(x-2)^2(x^2+6)</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solving <m>x^2+6=0</m> for <m>x</m> gives us additional roots:
          <m>x = -\sqrt6 i, 2,\sqrt6 i</m>.
          In summary, we have
          <me>
            f(x)= (x-2)(x-2)(x+\sqrt{6}i)(x-\sqrt{6}i)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So as <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_complexlinear">Proposition</xref> states,
          <m>f(x)</m> factors completely into a product of linear terms.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Although <m>f(x)</m> is a fourth degree polynomial,
        and factors into the product of 4 linear terms,
        yet it only has 3 <em>distinct</em>
        roots because of the repeated factor <m>(x-2)</m>.
        This agrees with <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_FTOA">Proposition</xref>,
        which implies that a polynomial of degree 4 has <em>at most</em>
        <m>n</m> distinct solutions.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      Take a moment to savor the full generality of <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_FTOAhard">Proposition</xref>.
      We don't have to restrict ourselves to polynomials with real coefficients:
      even if the polynomial's coefficients are imaginary or complex,
      the proposition still guarantees that the polynomial has a root.
      Further, <xref ref="proposition_Polynomials_complexlinear">Proposition</xref>
      then guarantees that it can be factored into a product of linear factors.
