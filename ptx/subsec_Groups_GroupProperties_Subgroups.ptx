    We first came across subgroups in the Permutations chapter.
    We saw that <m>S_n</m>, the set of permutations on a set of n elements,
    is a group under function composition.
    Yet we also saw that the set of symmetries of an <m>n</m>-sided figure,
    which is a subset of <m>S_n</m>,
    is itself a group under function composition.
    So a subgroup is a subset of a larger group that is itself a group under the same operation as the larger group.
    Formally then:

        {subgroup_defn} A <term>subgroup</term><idx><h>Subgroup</h><h>definition of</h></idx> <m>H</m> of a group
        <m>(G,\circ)</m> is a subset <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> such that when the group operation of <m>G</m> is restricted to <m>H</m>,
        <m>H</m> is a group in its own right.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    By definition, all subgroups are subsets:
    but is the reverse true?
        <idx><h>Subgroup</h><h>relation to subset</h></idx>
    If not, what makes a sub<em>set</em> a sub<em>group</em>?
    What special properties must subsets possess in order to qualify as subgroups?
  </p>
  <p>
    The key to answering this question is the observation that any subset
    <m>H \subset G</m> that is a subgroup of <m>G</m> must also be a group in its own right:
    and we're already experts at deciding whether a set with a binary operation is a group:

    <statement>

        Consider the set of even integers <m>2{\mathbb Z} = \{ \ldots, -2, 0, 2, 4, \ldots \}</m>.
        A more mathematically concise definition is:
        <me>
          2{\mathbb Z} = \{x \in {\mathbb Z} | x = 2n \mbox{ for some }  n \in {\mathbb Z} \}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>2{\mathbb Z}</m> is actually a subgroup of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>,
        under the operation of addition.
        To show this,
        according to the definition of subgroup we need to show:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>({\mathbb Z}, +)</m> is a group;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>2{\mathbb Z} \subset {\mathbb Z}</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(2{\mathbb Z}, +)</m> is a group.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Items (a) and (b) can be dispatched in short order.
        From our work in Chapters 1 and 2, we know
        <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is a group under addition:
        this takes care of (a).
        For item (b), we have that any element
        <m>m \in 2{\mathbb Z}</m> can be written as <m>m=2n</m>,
        where <m>n \in {\mathbb Z}</m>:
        hence <m>m \in {\mathbb Z}</m> also.
      </p>
      <p>
        To show (c), we must verify all the group properties for
        <m>2{\mathbb Z}</m> under the operation <m>+</m>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>(Closure)</em>: Given <m>x, y \in 2{\mathbb Z}</m>,
              it follows <m>x = 2n</m> and <m>y = 2m</m> for some <m>n,
              m \in {\mathbb Z}</m>.
              Therefore
              <me>
                x + y = 2n + 2m = 2(n + m)
              </me>
              Since <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> is closed under <m>+</m>,
              it follows <m>(n + m) \in {\mathbb Z}</m>,
              so <m>2(n+m) \in 2{\mathbb Z}</m>.
              Since <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> were arbitrary,
              it follows that <m>2{\mathbb Z}</m> is closed under addition.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>(Associative)</em>: Suppose <m>w,
              x, y \in 2{\mathbb Z}</m>.
              Then <m>w, x, y</m> are integers,
              and <m>w + (x + y) = (w + x) + y</m> by the associativity of <m>({\mathbb Z}, +)</m>.
              Hence <m>2{\mathbb Z}</m> is associative under addition.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>(Identity)</em>: <m>0 \in 2{\mathbb Z}</m>,
              since <m>2 \cdot 0 = 0</m>:
              and for any <m>x \in 2{\mathbb Z}</m>, <m>0 + x = x + 0 = x</m>.
              Hence <m>2{\mathbb Z}</m> has an identity under addition,
              namely <m>0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>(Inverse)</em>: Given <m>x \in 2{\mathbb Z}</m>, where <m>x = 2n</m>,
              <m>-x = -(2n) = 2(-n)</m>, [associative and commutative properties of
              <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> under multiplication] and since <m>-n \in {\mathbb Z}</m>
              (closure of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> under multiplication)
              it follows that <m>-x \in 2{\mathbb Z}</m>.
              Now since <m>-x + x = x + (-x) = 0</m>,
              it follows <m>\forall x \in 2{\mathbb Z}</m>,
              <m>\exists x^{-1} \in 2{\mathbb Z}</m>,
              namely <m>x^{-1} = -x</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        This completes the proof that
        <m>2{\mathbb Z}</m> is a subgroup of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> under addition.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Groups_63">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given any fixed integer <m>m</m>, prove that
        <me>
          m{\mathbb Z} = \{ \ldots, -2m, -m,  0, m, 2m, \ldots \}
        </me>
        is a subgroup of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> under the operation of addition.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    Notice that by definition,
    the operation used in the subgroup must be the <em>same</em>
    operation that's used in the group it's contained in.
    For example,
    <m>{\mathbb R}^{\ast}</m> is not a subgroup of <m>{\mathbb R}</m>,
    because <m>({\mathbb R}^{\ast}, +)</m> is not a group.
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Groups_64">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove or disprove:
        <ol type="a">

          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    We can make the task of proving subgroups a bit easier.
    First notice that in <xref ref="example_Groups_Z2subgroup">Example</xref>,
    <m>2{\mathbb Z}</m> was associative simply by virtue of the fact that it's contained in the group
    <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> and has the same operation.
    This will be true in general:
    the associate property will always hold for any subset of a group <m>G</m> under that group's operation.
    We may also make the following observation about identity elements:
  </p>
  <exercise xml:id="exercise_Groups_65">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove the following: Suppose <m>G</m> is a group with identity element <m>e</m>,
        and let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of <m>G</m> with identity element <m>f</m>.
        Then <m>e=f</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    The forgoing exercise and our observation about associativity lead to the following simplified subgroup criteria (which we state as a proposition):

  <proposition xml:id="proposition_Groups_subgroup_prove_2">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>H</m> be a subset of a group <m>G</m>.
        Then <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m> if and only if <m>H \neq \emptyset</m>,
        and whenever <m>g, h \in H</m> then <m>gh^{-1}</m> is in <m>H</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We first prove the
      <q>if</q>
      direction, so we assume <m>H</m> be a nonempty subset of <m>G</m> and whenever
      <m>g,
      h \in H</m> then <m>gh^{-1}</m> is in <m>H</m>.
      <xref ref="proposition_Groups_subgroup_prove">Proposition</xref>
      says that if <m>H</m> contains the identity and is closed under inverse and the group operation,
      then <m>H</m> is a subgroup.
      Let's prove these one by one.
      First, since <m>H</m> is nonempty,
      it contains some element <m>g</m>:
      and letting <m>h=g</m> we obtain <m>gg^{-1} = e</m> is in <m>H</m>.
      Second, since <m>e \in H</m> and <m>g \in H</m>,
      then <m>eg^{-1} = g^{-1}</m> is also in <m>H</m>:
      so <m>H</m> is closed under inverse.
      Finally, let <m>g, h \in H</m>.
      We must show that their product is also in <m>H</m>.
      But we have already shown that <m>h \in H</m> implies that <m>h^{-1} \in H</m>, so that,
      <m>g(h^{-1})^{-1} = gh \in H</m>.
      We have established the three required conditions,
      so we may conclude that <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove the
      <q>only if</q>
      ' direction,
      we may assume that <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.
      Given any elements <m>g,
      h \in H</m>, we need to show that <m>gh^{-1} \in H</m>.
      Since <m>h</m> is in <m>H</m>,
      its inverse <m>h^{-1}</m> must also be in <m>H</m>.
      Because of the closure of the group operation, <m>gh^{-1} \in H</m>.
      This completes the proof.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Using the proposition above,
        let's re-prove that <m>{\mathbb T}</m> is a subgroup of <m>{\mathbb C}^{\ast}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Based on the proposition, there are four things we need to show:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>{\mathbb C}^{\ast}</m> is a group;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>{\mathbb T} \neq \emptyset</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>{\mathbb T} \subset {\mathbb C}^{\ast}</m>;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Given <m>x, y \in {\mathbb T}</m>,
              <m>xy^{-1} \in {\mathbb T}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Items (a), (b), and (c) we have shown before.
        As to item (d),
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>x, y \in {\mathbb T}</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>\implies |x|=1 \mbox{ and } |y|=1</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>\implies |xy^{-1}|= |x|\cdot|y^{-1}| = |x|/|y| = 1/1 = 1</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>\implies |xy^{-1}| \in {\mathbb T}</m>
      </p>
    </proof>
