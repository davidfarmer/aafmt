    In <xref ref="Symmetry">Chapter</xref>
    we saw that all symmetries are bijections whose domain and codomain were the same.
    Thus symmetries are special cases of <em>permutations</em>,
    which are defined mathematically as follows.

        {defperm} A bijection whose domain and codomain are equal is called a

        The set of all bijections from a finite set <m>X</m> to itself is called the
        <term>set of permutations on <m>X</m></term>
        and is denoted as <m>S_X</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <statement>

        Let us recall for a moment the equilateral triangle
        <m>\bigtriangleup ABC</m> from the Symmetries chapter.
        Let <m>T</m> be the set of vertices of <m>\bigtriangleup ABC</m>; i.e.
        <m>T = \{ A, B, C \}</m>.
        We may list the permutations of <m>T</m> as follows.
        For input <m>A</m>, we have 3 possible outputs;
        then for <m>B</m> we would have two possible outputs (to keep the one-to-one property of each combination);
        and finally for <m>C</m> only one possible output.
        Therefore there are <m>3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6</m> permutations of <m>T</m>.
        Below are the six permutations in <m>S_T</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>\begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \\ A \amp  B \amp  C \end{pmatrix} \qquad \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \\ C \amp  A \amp  B \end{pmatrix} \qquad \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \\ B \amp  C \amp  A \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \\ A \amp  C \amp  B \end{pmatrix} \qquad \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \\ C \amp  B \amp  A \end{pmatrix} \qquad \begin{pmatrix}A \amp  B \amp  C \\ B \amp  A \amp  C \end{pmatrix}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Which of these permutations are symmetries of the equilateral triangle?
    In the Symmetries chapter we saw that they all are:
    so in this case the set of symmetries on <m>T</m> is equal to <m>S_T</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now suppose instead we label the vertices of an <em>isosceles</em>
    triangle as <m>A, B, C</m>,
    and let <m>T</m> represent these vertices.
    In this case, <m>S_T</m> is the same as before:
    it doesn't matter what arrangement or position the vertices are in,
    or even if <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>,
    and <m>C</m> are vertices at all.
    The permutations depend only on the set <m>T</m>,
    and are oblivious to whether or not they correspond to the vertices of some figure.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what about the symmetries of an isosceles triangle?
    It turns out that an isosceles triangle has only two symmetries
    (see exercise below).
    So the set of symmetries on <m>T</m> is a subset of <m>S_T</m>,
    but not the whole set.

        Suppose that the two congruent sides of triangle <m>ABC</m> are

        Give the two symmetries, in tableau form.

    Actually, <em>any</em> symmetry is a permutation,
    since a symmetry is by definition a bijection from a finite set of points to itself.
    But as we've seen in <xref ref="exercise_Permutations_isos_tri_sym">Exercises</xref>,
    <nbsp/> <xref ref="exercise_Permutations_tri_sym"></xref>,
    <nbsp/> <xref ref="exercise_Permutations_S_4"></xref>
    (as well as <xref ref="exercise_Symmetry_bijectnotsym">Exercise</xref> from the Symmetries chapter),
    <em>not</em> all permutations (bijections) are symmetries.
    Given a set <m>X</m> that represents a figure,
    the set of symmetries from <m>X \to X</m> is therefore a subset of <m>S_X</m>.
