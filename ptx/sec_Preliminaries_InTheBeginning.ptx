  Let's start at the very beginning
  A very good place to start
  When you read you begin with A B C
  When you sing you begin with Do Re Me
  <p>
    (Oscar Hammerstein, <em>The Sound of Music</em>)
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    God made the integers; all else is the work of man.
    (Leopold Kronecker, German mathematician, 1886)
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    If Maria had been more mathematically inclined, she might have continued:
    <q>When you count, you begin with 1 2 3</q>. Ordinarily we think of the
    <q>counting numbers</q>
    (which mathematicians call the <term>natural numbers</term>
    or <term>positive integers</term>) as the
    <q>very beginning</q>
    of math.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's true that when we learn math in school,
    we begin with the counting numbers.
    But do we really start at the
    <q>very beginning</q>? How do we know that <m>1 + 1 = 2</m>?
    How do we know that the methods we learned to add, multiply,
    divide, and subtract will always work?
    We've been taught how to factor integers into prime factors.
    But how do we know this always works?
  </p>
  <p>
    Mathematicians are the ultimate skeptics: they won't take
    <q>Everyone knows</q>
    or
    <q>It's obvious</q>
    as valid reasons.
    They keep asking
    <q>why</q>, breaking things down into the most basic assumptions possible.
    The very basic assumptions they end up with are called <term>axioms</term>.
        <idx><h>Axiom</h></idx>
    They then take these axioms and play with them like building blocks.
    The arguments that they build with these axioms are called <term>proofs</term>,
    and the conclusions of these proofs are called
    <term>propositions</term><idx><h>Proposition</h><h>mathematical</h></idx> or <term>theorems</term>.
        <idx><h>Theorem</h></idx>
  </p>
  <p>
    The mathematician's path is not an easy one.
    It is exceedingly difficult to push things back to their foundations.
    For example,
    arithmetic was used for thousands of years before a set of simple axioms was finally developed (you may look up
    <q>Peano axioms</q>
    on the web).<fn>
    The same is true for calculus.
    Newton and Leibniz first developed calculus around 1670,
    but it wasn't made rigorous until 150 years later.
    </fn> Since this is an elementary book,
    we are not going to try to meet rigorous mathematical standards.
    Instead, we'll lean heavily on examples,
    including the integers, rationals, and real numbers.
    Once you are really proficient with different examples,
    then it will be easier to follow more advanced ideas.<fn>
    Historically, mathematics has usually progressed this way:
    examples first,
    and axioms later after the examples are well-understood.
    </fn>

    This text is loaded with proofs,
    which are as unavoidable in abstract mathematics as they are intimidating to many students.
    We try to
    <q>tone things down</q>
    as much as possible.
    For example, we will take as
    <q>fact</q>
    many of the things that you learned in high school and college algebra<ndash/>even though you've never seen proofs of these
    <q>facts</q>. In the next section we remind you of some of these
    <q>facts</q>. When writing proofs or doing exercise feel free to use any of these facts.
    If you have to give a reason, you can just say
    <q>basic algebra</q>.

    We close this prologue with the assurance that abstract algebra is a beautiful subject that brings amazing insights into the nature of numbers,
    and the nature of Nature itself.
    Furthermore,
    engineers and technologists are finding more and more practical applications,
    as we shall see in some of the later chapters.
