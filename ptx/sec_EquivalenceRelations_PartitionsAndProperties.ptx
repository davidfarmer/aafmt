    We've defined binary relations in general.
    In this section we present one very important situation where binary relations are very useful.
    It turns out that the binary relations which arise in this situation have some very special properties,
    which will become very important later.

  <p>
    Given any set <m>A</m> with 2 or more elements,
    it's possible to split up the elements of <m>A</m> into disjoint subsets.
    We call such a division a <term>partition</term>.
    The mathematical definition is:
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        {defPartition} A <term>partition</term>
            <idx><h>Partition</h></idx>
        <m>\mathcal{P}</m> of a set<nbsp/><m>A</m> is a collection of nonempty subsets of<nbsp/><m>A</m>,
        such that each element of<nbsp/><m>A</m> is in exactly one of the subsets in <m>\mathcal{P}</m>.
        In other words:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <p>
              the union of the subsets in
              <m>\mathcal{P}</m> is all of<nbsp/><m>A</m>, and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              the subsets in <m>\mathcal{P}</m> are pairwise disjoint:
              that is the intersection of any two subsets is empty.
                <idx><h>Partition</h><h>definition of</h></idx>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Conditions (a) and (b) imply that every element of <m>A</m> is in exactly one subset in <m>\mathcal{P}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <remark>
    <p>
      Note that <m>\mathcal{P}</m> is defined as a set of subsets of <m>A</m>.
      This means that the elements of <m>\mathcal{P}</m> are <em>subsets</em>
      which may contain multiple elements of <m>A</m>.
      The examples below with make this clearer.
    </p>
  </remark>
  <example xml:id="example_EquivalenceRelations_partition1">
    <statement>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p>
            Consider the set of real numbers <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
            We know that every element of
            <m>\mathbb{R}</m> belongs to one of two sets:
            the set of rational numbers, <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>,
            or the set of irrational numbers, <m>\mathbb{I}</m>.
            The union of these two subsets,
            <m>\mathbb{Q} \cup \mathbb{I}=\mathbb{R}</m>,
            and <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> and <m>\mathbb{I}</m> are disjoint sets,
            so based on the definition
            <m>\{\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{I}\}</m> is a partition of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
            Alternatively the word
            <q>partition</q>
            can be used as a verb, so we could also say that <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> and
            <m>\mathbb{I}</m> partition <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

          <p>
            Let <m>\mathbb{E}</m> and <m>\mathbb{O}</m> be the even and odd integers,
            respectively.
            Then <m>\{\mathbb{E},\mathbb{O}\}</m> is a partition of <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>.
            Alternatively we could also say that <m>\mathbb{E}</m> and
            <m>\mathbb{O}</m> partition <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>.

          <p>
            Let <m>S</m> be the set of all single-element subsets of <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>,
            so that for example <m>\{-552\}</m>,
            <m>\{7\}</m>, <m>\{1492\}</m> are all elements of <m>S</m>.
            Then <m>S</m> is also a partition of <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>.
            Here <m>S</m> has an infinite number of elements
            (all the single-element subsets of <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>),
            but each element of <m>S</m> is a finite set.

        <li>
          <p>
            Consider the set of complex numbers <m>\mathbb{C}</m>.
            Every element of <m>\mathbb{C}</m> has a real part which we denote as Re<m>[z]</m>
            (as in Chapter 2).
            Let <m>R_a</m> be the set of all complex numbers with real part <m>a</m>, i.e.
            <m>R_a:=\{z \in \mathbb{C} \mid \text{ Re } [z]=a\}</m>.
            Let <m>\mathcal{P}</m> be the set consisting of all of the <m>R_a</m>'s, i.e.
            <m>\mathcal{P}:=\{R_a \forall a \in \mathbb{R}\}</m>.
            Then <m>\mathcal{P}</m> is a partition of <m>\mathbb{C}</m>.
            Here <m>\mathcal{P}</m> has an infinite number of elements,
            where each element of <m>\mathcal{P}</m> is an infinite set.

    From the previous example you can see how partitions of sets of numbers are collections of subsets that divide up bigger sets.
    You could imagine it's like a little kid with a bucket of LEGO<sup>\textcircled{{ R}}</sup> bricks who's sorting them out into different piles.
    The LEGOs could be sorted by color, shape,
    number of studs, or the original set in which they were bought.
    Similarly there are lots of different ways to sort out sets of numbers,
    mathematical objects, or any arbitrary sets with elements of any kind.
    Each different way of sorting gives rise to a different partition.

            When making an inventory of the animals in a zoo,
            we may wish to count the number of antelopes,
            the number of baboons, the number of cheetahs, and so forth.
            In this case,
            all of the animals of the same species might be grouped together in a single set.
            Each species give rise to a different set and these sets form a partition of the animals in that zoo.

            If we are concerned only with people's given names
            (what Americans would call
            <q>first name</q>),
            we can partition any set of people according to given name.
            Each set in the partition consists of all people who share a particular given name.

            In geometry,
            sometimes we are interested only in the shape of a triangle and not its location or orientation.
            In this case, we talk about <em>congruent</em> triangles,
            where congruent means that corresponding sides of the two triangles are equal,
            and corresponding angles are also equal.
            For any triangle we may define the set of all triangles congruent to that triangle.
            There are an infinite number of such sets which form a partition of the set of all triangles.

    What do partitions have to do with relations?
    We will illustrate with the following example.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>A=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}</m> and partition these six numbers into evens and odds.
    Then we would have two subsets each with three elements.
    Suppose we use a six-sided die to determine a random outcome:
    where if we get an even number we win a dollar,
    but an odd number we lose a dollar.
    We don't care whether we get a 2, 4, or 6 <mdash/> only that we get an even number because we win the same amount regardless.
    In this way, rolling a 2, 4, or 6 are <em>related</em>.
    Formally we can define a relation on <m>A</m> as follows: Given <m>a,b \in A</m>,
    then <m>a \rel b</m> iff <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are either both even or both odd.
  </p>
  <p>
    We generalize the previous example in the following definition.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        {partitionrelation} Given a partition <m>\mathcal{P}</m> on <m>A</m>,
        we may define a binary relation <m>\rel_\mathcal{P}\,\subset A \times A</m> as follows:
        for <m>a,b \in A</m>,
        <m>a \rel_\mathcal{P} b</m> iff <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both contained in the same subset in the partition.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

    We already know that binary relations can be represented graphically.
    In the following exercise,
    we investigate graphical representations of some binary relations that come from partitions.

    To further explore <xref ref="definition_EquivalenceRelations_partitionrelation">Definition</xref>,
    we let <m>A=\{a,b,c,\ldots,i\}</m> which has been partitioned into subsets <m>A_1, \ldots, A_5</m>.
    <xref ref="fig_partition_discrete">Figure</xref> has a drawing of <m>A</m>.

  <p>
    From <xref ref="fig_partition_discrete">Figure</xref>,
    we can tell some properties of <m>\rel_\mathcal{P}</m>:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Each element of <m>A</m> is related to itself, that is:
          <me>
            a \rel_\mathcal{P} a
          </me>
          (this is called the <em>reflexive</em><idx><h>Reflexive</h><h>property of relations</h></idx>
            <idx><h>Relation</h><h>reflexive</h></idx>
          property).
          We know this is true because <m>a</m> is certainly in the same set of the partition as itself.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If an element is related to another element the relation also goes in the other direction.
          That is:
          <me>
            a \rel_\mathcal{P} b \implies b \rel_\mathcal{P} a
          </me>
          (this is called the <em>symmetric</em><idx><h>Symmetric</h><h>property of relations</h></idx>
            <idx><h>Relation</h><h>symmetric</h></idx>
          property We know this is true because if <m>a</m> is related to <m>b</m>,
          then that means that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are in the same set of the partition.
          Since they are in the same set of the partition as each other <m>b</m> is also related to <m>a</m>.
          This argument can easily be repeated in the other direction.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If an element is related to another element and that element is related to a third element,
          then the first element is related to the third.
          That is:
          <me>
            a \rel_\mathcal{P} b \text{ and }  b \rel_\mathcal{P} c \Rightarrow a \rel_\mathcal{P} c
          </me>
          (this is called the <em>transitive</em>
          property<idx><h>Transitive</h><h>property of relations</h></idx>
            <idx><h>Relation</h><h>transitive</h></idx>) We know this is true because if <m>a</m> is related to <m>b</m> then they are in the same set of the partition, and if <m>b</m> is related to <m>c</m> then they too are in the same set of the partition.
          This means that <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
          and <m>c</m> are all in the same set of the partition,
          therefore <m>a</m> is related to <m>c</m>.

      Earlier in the chapter we showed that the binary relation
      <m>\rel_\mathcal{P}</m> from the partition in <xref ref="fig_partition_discrete">Figure</xref> was reflexive,
      symmetric, and transitive.
      The arguments that we used are generally applicable,
      and can be used for any partition.

          In <xref ref="proposition_EquivalenceRelations_partbinrel">Proposition</xref> parts (a),(b),
          and (c) we used mathematical symbolism to express the concepts that were explained verbally in the discussion prior to <xref ref="example_EquivalenceRelations_relfrompart1">Example</xref>.
          Increasingly,
          you'll be expected to understand symbolism without verbal explanation.
          Here's a chance for you to practice:
          what does the following symbolism mean,
          and where have you seen it before?
          <me>
            a \sim b  \iff  \exists C \in \mathcal{P}, ( a \in C \text{ and }  b \in C )
          </me>.
          (Answer: this is the definition of  the relation <m>\sim</m>  defined in <xref ref="proposition_EquivalenceRelations_partbinrel">Proposition</xref>,
          expressed symbolically.
          We'll be using this symbolism in later propositions, e.g.
          <xref ref="proposition_EquivalenceRelations_parteqrel">Proposition</xref>.)

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Even though the definition of symmetry begins with
          <q><m>\forall a,b \in A \ldots</m></q>
          (
          <q>for every <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>A \ldots</m></q>
          ) symmetry doesn't require <em>every</em>
          pair of elements to be related to each other:
          symmetry only requires that whenever the <em>if</em>
          clause (<m>a \rel b</m>) is true,
          the <em>then</em> clause (<m>b \rel a</m>) must also be true.
          A similar caveat applies to transitivity.

    These properties are so important that we have a special term for binary relations that satisfy all three properties:

    In the following sections we'll consider more examples of equivalence relations , but first let's make sure we understand reflexivity,
    symmetry and transitivity:
  </p>
  <example xml:id="example_EquivalenceRelations_binrelR">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the following binary relations on <m>{\mathbb R}</m>:

            <p>
              <m>=</m> is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Reflexive: any real number <m>x</m> equals itself,
                    so <m>x=x~\forall x \in {\mathbb R}</m>.

                <li>

        Let's think about binary relations on
        <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> as seen in <xref ref="fig_transnotrefsym">Figure</xref>.
        Which of the binary relations, A, B, or C, are transitive?
        Why or why not?

      <p>
        Is the relation in A transitive?
        Let's consider Remember how transitivity is defined:
        if <m>a \rel b</m> and <m>b \rel c</m> then <m>a \rel c</m>.
        In more prosaic terms,
        if there's an arrow from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> and another arrow from <m>b</m> to <m>c</m>,
        then there's an arrow directly from <m>a</m> to <m>c</m>.
        We may conceptualize this as follows.
        Suppose <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
        and <m>c</m> represent airports,
        and arrows represent flights between airports.
        In terms of this example,
        transitivity means that whenever there's an indirect route between airports
        (with multiple stops),
        then there's also a direct route.
        So in the case of relation A, we may notice there's an indirect route from 3 to 2 by going through 1, but there's also a direct route from 3 to 2
        (or more formally, <m>3 \rel 1</m>,
        <m>1 \rel 2</m>, and <m>3 \rel 2</m>).
        Furthermore this is the only example in A of an indirect route.
        Therefore this relation is transitive.
        If <m>3 \rel 2</m> is removed from this binary relation,
        then the relation isn't transitive because it's still be possible to get from 3 to 2 via 1, but there's no longer a direct route.
      </p>
      <p>
        How about the relation in digraph B? This may be the most confusing of the bunch.
        One might think that B is not transitive,
        since there's only a single arrow<ndash/>but think again.
        The definition of transitive says : <em><em>if</em></em>
        <m>a \rel b</m> and <m>b \rel c</m> then <m>a \rel c</m>.
        You may also read the
        <q>if</q>
        as
        <q>whenever</q>: <em>Whenever</em> <m>a \rel b</m> and
        <m>b \rel c</m> then it's also true that <m>a \rel c</m>.
        But in relation B, the
        <q>whenever</q>
        <em>never holds</em>,
        because there are no cases of <m>a \rightarrow b</m> and
        <m>b\rightarrow c</m> (i.e. there are no indirect routes).
        This being the case, the
        <q>if</q>
        statement is considered true by default, so B is transitive.
        This is an important point worth remembering:
        in mathematical logic,
        a statement is considered true if no counterexample exists.
        In other words, if you can <em>prove</em>
        that there's no counterexample to a mathematical statement,
        then the statement is true!<fn>
        Here are some
        <q>true statements</q>, according to this rule : (i) If you see a rainbow in the sky and follow it to where it touches the ground,
        you will find a leprechaun with a pot of gold; (ii) If you pick up an ordinary guinea pig by its tail,
        then its eyes will fall out. (iii) If you give a correct proof that 1=0, then Bill Gates will give you his entire fortune.
        </fn>
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, the relation in digraph C is
        <em>not</em> transitive.
        At first glance it seems like it should be transitive because so many transitivity conditions are satisfied (e.g.
        <m>1 \rel 2</m> and <m>2 \rel 3 \Rightarrow 1 \rel 3</m>, etc),
        however we can also find transitivity conditions that fail (see part (a) of the following exercise)<ndash/>and it only takes one counterexample to disprove a statement.
