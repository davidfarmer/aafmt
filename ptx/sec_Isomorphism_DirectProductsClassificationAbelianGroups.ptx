  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_Functions_CartesianProduct">Section</xref>
      we introduced the notion of the Cartesian product of sets . The formal definition is given in <xref ref="definition_Functions_cartesianprod">Definition</xref><ndash/>the basic idea is is to take the set of all pairs of elements <m>(a,b)</m> where <m>a</m> is an element of the first set and <m>b</m> is an element of the second.
      A simple example to keep in mind is <m>{\mathbb R} \times {\mathbb R}</m>,
      which is the plane with Cartesian coordinates <m>(x,y)</m>.
      Notice that <m>{\mathbb R} \times {\mathbb R}</m> is an additive group,
      where the addition is defined by performing addition separately on both coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out that this example can be generalized.
      Given two groups <m>G</m> and <m>H</m>,
      it is possible to construct a new group based on the Cartesian product <m>G \times H</m>.
      Even more exciting, it is sometimes possible to
      <q>factor</q>
      a large group by expressing it as the Cartesian product of smaller groups.
      In this case,
      all of the properties of the large group can be derived from the properties of the smaller groups,
      which can lead to tremendous simplification.
      This process of factoring groups into simpler groups can be compared to the factorization of integers into primes.
      (We will in fact see some deep connections between these two processes.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin by showing that the Cartesian product of groups does inded yield a group.

    <p>
      If <m>(G,\cdot)</m> and <m>(H, \circ)</m> are groups,
      then we can make the Cartesian product of <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> into a new group.
      As a set, our group is just the ordered pairs
      <m>(g, h) \in G \times H</m> where <m>g \in G</m> and <m>h \in H</m>.
      We can define a binary operation on <m>G \times H</m> by
      <me>
        (g_1, h_1)(g_2, h_2) = (g_1 \cdot g_2, h_1 \circ h_2);
      </me>
      that is, we just multiply elements in the first coordinate as we do in <m>G</m> and elements in the second coordinate as we do in <m>H</m>.
      We have specified the particular operations <m>\cdot</m> and <m>\circ</m> in each group here for the sake of clarity;
      we usually just write <m>(g_1, h_1)(g_2, h_2) = (g_1  g_2, h_1 h_2)</m>.

      The group <m>G \times H</m> is called the

      Notice the important difference between <sq>Cartesian product</sq> and ' direct product': the direct product is a group whose underlying set is a Cartesian product;
      but in addition, the direct product has a group operation,
      which generic off-the-shelf Cartesian products don't ordinarily have.

        <p>
          We have previously seen that the elements of the dihedral group <m>D_4</m> can be listed as
          <m>\{id,
          r,r^2, r^3, sr,sr^2, sr^3 \}</m> where <m>r</m> is counterclockwise rotation by <m>\pi/2</m> and <m>s</m> is a reflection.
          We also know that<m>S=\{1,s\}</m> and
          <m>R_4 = \{id,
          r, r^2, r^3 \}</m> are subgroups of <m>D_4</m> and thus groups in their own right.
          It is very tempting to conjecture that <m>D_4</m> can be written as <m>S \times R_4</m>,
          where the notation <m>(s^j,r^k)</m> is just another way of writing <m>s^j r^k</m> for <m>j=0,1</m> and <m>k = 0,1,2,3</m>.
          But as it happens, this doesn't work out:
          things are not so simple
          (and much more interesting!),
          as you will show in the following exercise.
        </p>

    </example>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>f: S \times R_r \rightarrow D_4</m> defined by
          <m>f( (s^j,r^k) ) =s^j r^k</m> for <m>j=0,1</m> and <m>k=0,1,2,3</m>.
          Give an example of two elements for which the operation preserving property fails.

      One may notice from <xref ref="example_Isomorphism_D5">Example</xref>
      that <m>S</m> and <m>R_4</m> were abelian groups, and <m>D_4</m> is not.
      Our experience with this example suggests that this may be a recipe for failure<ndash/>perhaps it's not possible to take the direct product of abelian groups and get a nonabelian group.
      This time our conjecture is correct,
      as you will show in the following exercise.

    <p>
      So that takes care of abelian groups.
      Another important type of group is cyclic groups.
      We'll talk a lot more later about direct products of cyclic groups.
      For now, let's consider first of all whether the product of cyclic groups is always cyclic:
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example_Isomorphism_Z2xZ2">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider
          <me>
            {\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2 = \{ (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0),(1, 1) \}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although <m>{\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2</m> and
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_4</m> both contain four elements, they are not isomorphic.
          We can prove this by noting that <m>{\mathbb Z}_4</m> is cyclic,
          while every element <m>(a,b)</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2</m> has order 2
          (verify this).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      So we've shown that the direct product of cyclic groups is not necessarily cyclic.
      How about the converse: that is,
      if a direct product is cyclic,
      are the factor groups necessarily cyclic?
      This time, the answer is yes:

      Let's now consider a different type of question.
      What's the difference between

      Not much, as the following exercise shows:

      So far we've been considering the products of two groups.
      But there's no reason to stop with two!
      The direct product

        \prod_{i = 1}^n G_i = G_1 \times G_2 \times \cdots \times G_n
      </me>
      of the groups <m>G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_n</m> may be defined in a similar way.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How would you write an element in <m>\prod_{i = 1}^n G_i</m>?
          Write two different elements of <m>\prod_{i = 1}^n G_i</m>,
          and show how you would define the group operation in terms of these two elements. (You may denote the group operation on each group <m>G_i</m> by the symbol <sq><m>\cdot</m></sq>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      If we're taking the direct product of copies of the same group,
      we may use power notation:
      <m>G \times G = G^2, G \times G \times G = G^3</m>, and so on.

          The group <m>{\mathbb Z}_2^n</m>,

          The group operation is the
          <q>exclusive or</q>
          of two binary <m>n</m>-tuples.
          For example,

    <title>Classifying finite abelian groups by factorization</title>
    <p>
      We have used isomorphisms to classify cyclic groups
      (<xref ref="proposition_Isomorphism_isomorph_theorem_2">Proposition</xref>),
      as well as to characterize groups in general (Cayley's theorem,
      <xref ref="proposition_Isomorphism_isomorph_theorem_6">Proposition</xref>).
      In this section,
      we will make use of direct products to prove a classification of finite abelian groups up to isomorphism.
      The bottom line is that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power oders.
      To get to this bottom line,
      we'll have to establish some more properties of direct products,
      especially in relation to cyclic groups.
      The following proposition characterizes the order of the elements in a direct product.

          Let <m>(g, h) \in G \times H</m>.
          If <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> have finite orders <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> respectively,
          then the order of <m>(g, h)</m> in
          <m>G \times H</m> is the least common multiple of <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>.

        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>m</m> is the least common multiple of <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> and let <m>n = |(g,h)|</m>.
        Then
        <md>
          <mrow>(g,h)^m  = (g^m, h^m) = (e_G,e_H)</mrow>
          <mrow>(g^n, h^n)  = (g, h)^n = (e_G,e_H)</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, <m>n</m> must divide <m>m</m>, and <m>n \leq m</m>.
        However, by the second equation,
        both <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> must divide <m>n</m>;
        therefore, <m>n</m> is a common multiple of <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>.
        Since <m>m</m> is the <em>least</em>
        common multiple of <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>, <m>m \leq n</m>.
        Consequently, <m>m</m> must be equal to<nbsp/><m>n</m>.

      The next proposition tells us exactly when the direct product of two cyclic groups is cyclic.

    <proposition xml:id="proposition_Isomorphism_Z_pq_theorem">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The group <m>{\mathbb Z}_m \times {\mathbb Z}_n</m> is isomorphic to
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_{mn}</m> if and only if <m>\gcd(m,n)=1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Assume first that if <m>{\mathbb Z}_m \times {\mathbb Z}_n \cong {\mathbb Z}_{mn}</m>,
        then <m>\gcd(m, n) = 1</m>.
        To show this, we will prove the contrapositive;
        that is, we will show that if <m>\gcd(m, n) = d > 1</m>,
        then <m>{\mathbb Z}_m \times {\mathbb Z}_n</m> cannot be cyclic.
        Notice that <m>mn/d</m> is divisible by both <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>;
        hence, for any element <m>(a,b) \in {\mathbb Z}_m \times {\mathbb Z}_n</m>,
        <me>
          \underbrace{(a,b) + (a,b)+ \cdots + (a,b)}_{mn/d \; { times}} = (0, 0)

        Therefore, no <m>(a, b)</m> can generate all of <m>{\mathbb Z}_m \times {\mathbb Z}_n</m>.

      <p>
        The converse follows directly from <xref ref="proposition_Isomorphism_isomorph_lcm_theorem">Proposition</xref>
        since <m>\lcm(m,n) = mn</m> if and only if <m>\gcd(m,n)=1</m>.

      Recall that <xref ref="proposition_Isomorphism_isomorph_theorem_3">Proposition</xref>

      So <xref ref="proposition_Isomorphism_Z_pq_theorem">Proposition</xref>
      tells us that the product of two cyclic groups is cyclic if and only if their orders are relatively prime.

          All abelian groups <m>G</m> of order 21 are isomorphic and cyclic.

      What we've shown for specific primes in <xref ref="example_Isomorphism_elementOrders">Example</xref>
      and <xref ref="exercise_Isomorphism_exel">Exercise</xref> is true in general:
      groups with orders divisible by <m>p</m> always contain elements of order <m>p</m>.
      This is true for nonabelian as well as abelian groups:
      this fact is known as <term>Cauchy's theorem</term>.
      At this point we're not able to prove Cauchy's theorem for nonabelian groups,
      but Cauchy's theorem for abelian groups can be proved using methods similar to those above.
      We'll state the theorem formally, then ask you to prove it.

      We may also recall that Lagrange's theorem
      (<xref ref="proposition_Cosets_LagrangeTheorem">Proposition</xref>)
      enables us to conclude that the order of any subgroup <m>H \in G</m> must divide <m>|G|</m>.
      <xref ref="proposition_Isomorphism_FactorabelianGroup">Proposition</xref> enables us to go one better.

          Let us show that <m>G</m> has a subgroup of order 25.
          From <xref ref="proposition_Isomorphism_FactorabelianGroup">Proposition</xref>,
          we know that there are 3 possible cases for <m>G</m>: (i) <m>G \cong {\mathbb Z}_{125}</m>; (ii)

          In case (i), then the isomorphic image of

          Suppse that <m>7^2</m> divides <m>|G|</m>.
          Let us show that <m>G</m> has a subgroup of order 49.
          From <xref ref="proposition_Isomorphism_FactorabelianGroup">Proposition</xref>,
          we know that either(i) <m>G</m> has a factor
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_{7^k}</m> where <m>k \ge 2</m>;

          In case (i),

          In this case, then the isomorphic image of

          where once again <m>H</m> is a direct product of copies of
